# Session Checkpoint - 2025-01-09

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- Upgraded Aichaku from v0.5.0 to v0.16.0 in the project
- Shaped up a comprehensive enhancement suite for Aichaku with four major features
- Created detailed Shape Up pitch and design documentation
- Analyzed security implementations from Nagare and Salty projects
- Incorporated 15-factor app guidelines (both cloud-native and static site versions)

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Claude Code Hooks Integration**: Leverage the new hooks feature for automated methodology enforcement rather than runtime prompt modification
2. **Lightweight Role System**: Simple 3x3 role matrix (3 work modes Ã— 3 perspectives) instead of complex personas
3. **Modular Guidance Architecture**: Extend existing marker system to support multiple configurable sections (methodology, security, architecture, etc.)
4. **Keep SECURITY_WORKFLOWS.md in Aichaku**: Move to `.claude/methodologies/security/` for better integration

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `.claude/output/active-2025-01-09-aichaku-hooks-integration/STATUS.md` - Project status tracking
- `.claude/output/active-2025-01-09-aichaku-hooks-integration/pitch.md` - Comprehensive Shape Up pitch
- `.claude/output/active-2025-01-09-aichaku-hooks-integration/modular-guidance-design.md` - Detailed module system design
- `.claude/output/active-2025-01-09-aichaku-hooks-integration/security-workflows-analysis.md` - Analysis and recommendations

### Modified
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with latest Aichaku v0.16.0 integration rules

## Problems Solved

1. **Hook Integration Strategy**: Designed a comprehensive system for leveraging Claude Code's new hooks feature
2. **Guidance Modularity**: Created architecture for incorporating OWASP, ISO 27001, 15-factor, and custom standards
3. **Role Confusion**: Clarified that "roles" meant Claude Code hooks, not AI personas
4. **Security Documentation**: Identified how to make hidden security workflows discoverable

## Lessons Learned

1. **Existing Patterns Are Powerful**: The marker system in integrate.ts can be extended for modular sections
2. **Cross-Project Learning**: Security implementations in Nagare and Salty provide excellent templates
3. **15-Factor Evolution**: The 15-factor approach extends 12-factor with modern cloud-native concerns
4. **Hook Potential**: Claude Code hooks can automate many manual methodology enforcement tasks

## Next Steps

1. Review the pitch and design documents after rest
2. Implement hook templates and `aichaku hooks` command
3. Create modular guidance sections from existing security content
4. Update integrate.ts to support multiple section types
5. Move SECURITY_WORKFLOWS.md to appropriate location
6. Test hook integration with real workflows
