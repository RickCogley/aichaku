# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-09

## Summary of Work Accomplished
- Investigated Claude Code memory management and slash command functionality
- Identified that slash commands in ~/.claude/settings.json are not automatically loaded/executed
- Read and summarized both global memory (~/.claude/config.md) and project memory (./CLAUDE.md)
- Successfully executed the /checkpoint command to create this session summary

## Key Technical Decisions
- Confirmed that slash commands in settings.json are designed as saved prompts rather than auto-executing commands
- Established that memory configuration is properly loaded from both global and project-specific CLAUDE.md files
- Recognized that the /memin command functionality needs to be manually triggered rather than expecting automatic execution

## Files Created/Modified
### Created
- `.claude/sessions/2025-07-09.md` - Session checkpoint documenting today's work

### Modified
- None

## Problems Solved
- Clarified why /memin wasn't automatically executing (it's a saved prompt, not an auto-command)
- Successfully demonstrated how to access and summarize memory configuration files
- Established proper checkpoint creation workflow

## Lessons Learned
- Claude Code slash commands in settings.json are template prompts, not automatic commands
- Memory management works through CLAUDE.md files at global (~/.claude/config.md) and project levels
- The checkpoint system successfully creates session summaries in .claude/sessions/

## Next Steps
- Consider implementing a more automated way to trigger slash commands if needed
- Continue using manual memory loading when starting new sessions
- Maintain regular checkpoints to track session progress

## Session Update - 2025-07-09 (Later)

### Additional Work Completed
- Investigated .claude/sessions/ directory structure
- Confirmed session file naming convention as YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Successfully appended to existing daily session file

### Technical Observations
- Session files use date-based naming (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
- Multiple sessions on the same day append to the same file with separator
- The checkpoint system maintains continuity within daily work

### Current Status
- Successfully saved current session progress
- Maintained consistency with existing session format
- No new files created (appended to existing 2025-07-09.md)
