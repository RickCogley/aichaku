# Create Test Files - Pitch

## Problem
Security Tests workflow is failing because it expects test files but none exist. The workflow runs `deno test` which returns an error when no test modules are found.

## Appetite
2 weeks

## Solution
1. Create basic test files for core functionality
2. Modify the workflow to gracefully handle when no tests exist
3. Ensure tests follow Deno conventions

### Rough Sketch

**Test Structure:**
```
src/
├── commands/
│   ├── init_test.ts
│   └── integrate_test.ts
└── mod_test.ts
```

**Workflow Modification:**
```yaml
- name: Run all tests with coverage
  run: |
    if find . -name "*_test.ts" -type f | grep -q .; then
      deno test --allow-all --coverage=coverage
    else
      echo "No test files found, skipping tests"
    fi
```

## Rabbit Holes
- Don't create comprehensive test suite yet
- Don't test every edge case
- Don't add complex test utilities

## No-gos
- We're NOT adding external testing frameworks
- We're NOT testing methodology files
- We're NOT creating integration tests

## Nice to Have
- Basic smoke tests that verify core functionality
- Tests that can be expanded later
- Clear test structure for future additions
