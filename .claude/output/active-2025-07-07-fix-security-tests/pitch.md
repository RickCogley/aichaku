# Fix Security Tests - Pitch

## Problem
The Security Tests GitHub Action is failing on every commit due to formatting issues in CLAUDE.md. The formatter is complaining about line breaks and whitespace in the Aichaku integration section that was added by the `aichaku integrate` command.

## Appetite
2 weeks (but actually just a few minutes)

## Solution
Two issues need fixing:
1. ~~CLAUDE.md formatting (already fixed)~~
2. No test files exist, causing test step to fail

### Rough Sketch
1. ~~Run `deno fmt` on CLAUDE.md to fix formatting~~ âœ“
2. Create basic test files
3. Modify workflow to handle no tests gracefully
4. Security tests should pass

## Rabbit Holes
- Don't try to fix the integrate command itself right now
- Don't modify the content, just the formatting
- Don't change the security test configuration

## No-gos
- We're NOT disabling the security tests
- We're NOT changing the formatter rules
- We're NOT modifying the content of CLAUDE.md

## Nice to Have
- Consider fixing the integrate command in a future iteration to output properly formatted content
