# Cycle Plan - Aichaku Development

**Dates**: 2025-01-04 - 2025-01-05 (Accelerated for demo)  
**Cool-down**: 2025-01-06 (Documentation)

## Bets for This Cycle

### üéØ Bet 1: Aichaku Methodology System

**Team**: Rick + Claude Code  
**Appetite**: 6 weeks (compressed to 2 days for demo)  
**Pitch**: See pitch.md

**Why we're betting on this**:
- High user demand for simpler methodology support
- Current persona system too complex (70+ files)
- Natural language approach aligns with Claude Code strengths
- Can revolutionize how developers adopt good practices

**Success looks like**:
- [x] Three-mode system implemented
- [x] 5 methodologies converted to simple format
- [x] 80% reduction in file count
- [x] Natural language detection working
- [x] Documentation and examples complete

## Not Betting On

These were considered but didn't make the cut:

### ‚ùå Custom Methodology Builder
**Reason**: Core system needs to prove itself first  
**Future**: Version 2.0 after user feedback

### ‚ùå Analytics Dashboard
**Reason**: Privacy concerns, adds complexity  
**Future**: Let it go - not aligned with philosophy

### ‚ùå Web Interface
**Reason**: CLI and conversation interface sufficient  
**Future**: Reconsider if strong user demand

## Teams & Capacity

**Team A**: Rick (Product/Direction) + Claude Code (Implementation)
- Working on: Entire Aichaku system
- Capacity: Full dedication

## Important Dates

- **Cycle Start**: 2025-01-04
- **Mid-cycle Check**: 2025-01-04 PM
- **Cycle End**: 2025-01-05
- **Cool-down Start**: 2025-01-06
- **Next Betting Table**: After launch feedback

## Notes

This is an accelerated cycle for demonstration purposes. In reality, this would be a full 6-week cycle with proper pacing. The compressed timeline shows the methodology in action while delivering real value.

Key constraints:
- Must work with existing Claude Code
- Cannot break current Shape Up users
- Must be genuinely simpler
- Documentation is part of shipping
