**Status**: ACTIVE - Complete, ready for release
**Started**: 2025-01-06
**Target**: v0.5.0

## Current Phase
ðŸ”¨ EXECUTION MODE - Implementation complete, ready for release

## Progress
- [x] Problem identified: Project init copies files unnecessarily
- [x] Shaped solution: Global methodologies, project customizations only
- [x] Documented improvements needed
- [x] Implementation plan created
- [x] Before/after comparison documented
- [x] Execute all changes:
  - [x] Redesigned init command for global/project split
  - [x] Fixed redundant messaging across all commands
  - [x] Created beautiful output formatting
  - [x] Enhanced all commands with better UX
  - [x] Updated methodology files with folder structure
- [x] Test new implementation
- [ ] Release v0.5.0

## Key Decisions
1. Project init will NOT copy methodology files
2. Global install is prerequisite
3. Interactive prompt for integrate command
4. Minimal project footprint (.claude/user/ and marker file)

## Next Steps
1. Finish collecting other improvement areas
2. Create implementation plan
3. Execute all improvements together for v0.5.0
