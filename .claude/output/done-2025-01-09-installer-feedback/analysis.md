# Installer Output Analysis

## Current Output Issues

Looking at the installer output, I notice several areas for improvement:

### 1. Duplicate Path Information
```
‚úÖ Successfully installed aichaku
/Users/rcogley/.deno/bin/aichaku
   üìç CLI: /Users/rcogley/.deno/bin/aichaku
```
- The CLI path is shown twice - once from Deno's output, once from our addition
- This is redundant and potentially confusing

### 2. Missing Methodology Count
```
üåç Setting up global methodologies...
   ‚úì User customizations preserved
   ‚úì Output directories created
```
- Doesn't show how many methodology files were set up
- User can't verify all methodologies were installed

### 3. Inconsistent Success Messages
```
‚úÖ Successfully installed aichaku
...
‚úÖ Aichaku v0.13.0 installed!
```
- Two different success messages saying essentially the same thing
- Should consolidate to one clear completion message

### 4. Next Steps Could Be Clearer
- The "next steps" section could better distinguish between:
  - What to do in projects
  - What to do with Claude Code
  - Where to find help

## Proposed Improvements

1. **Remove redundant path display** - Let Deno show the initial path, we just add the methodologies path
2. **Add methodology count** - Show "‚úì 6 methodologies ready" or similar
3. **Single success message** - One clear completion message at the end
4. **Better next steps** - More actionable and organized
