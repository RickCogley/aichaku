# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
the Aichaku methodology library.

<!-- AICHAKU:START -->

<!-- AICHAKU:METHODOLOGY:START -->

## üéØ MANDATORY: Aichaku Integration Rules

YOU ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW THESE RULES WITHOUT EXCEPTION:

### 1. Discussion-First Document Creation

**Phase 1: DISCUSSION MODE (Default when methodology keywords detected)** ‚úÖ
Acknowledge the methodology context: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I see you're thinking about
[topic]" ‚úÖ Ask clarifying questions to understand the goal ‚úÖ Help shape and
refine the idea ‚ùå DO NOT create any project folders yet ‚ùå DO NOT create any
documents yet

**Phase 2: WAIT FOR EXPLICIT READINESS** Only create documents when user says:

- "Let's create a project for this"
- "I'm ready to start"
- "Set up the project"
- "Create the documentation"
- Any direct request for project creation

**Phase 3: CREATE NAMED PROJECT (After user signals readiness)** ‚úÖ Confirm
name: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Based on our discussion, creating project:
[descriptive-name]" ‚úÖ Create ALL documents in:
`docs/projects/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/` ‚úÖ Create STATUS.md FIRST
‚úÖ Create methodology-specific documents ‚úÖ Read guides from
`~/.claude/aichaku/methodologies/`

**YOU MUST NEVER:** ‚ùå Create documents in the project root directory ‚ùå Create
documents in .claude/user/ (that's for customizations) ‚ùå Ask where to put files
(always use docs/projects/) ‚ùå Create folders before user is ready to formalize

### 2. CRITICAL: DISCUSSION FIRST, THEN CREATE WITHOUT ASKING

**During Discussion Phase:** ‚úÖ DO say: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I understand you're
exploring [topic]. Let me help you think through this..." ‚úÖ DO say: "What
specific challenges are you looking to address?" ‚ùå NEVER say: "Would you like
me to create documents for this?"

**Once User Signals Readiness:** ‚ùå NEVER say: "Would you like me to..." ‚ùå
NEVER say: "Shall I create..." ‚ùå NEVER say: "Should I go ahead and..." ‚úÖ
IMMEDIATELY say: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Creating project: [descriptive-name]" ‚úÖ
IMMEDIATELY say: "Setting up Shape Up documentation..." ‚úÖ IMMEDIATELY say:
"Generating sprint planning templates..."

**THE RULE:** Discuss and refine FIRST. Once user signals readiness, CREATE
IMMEDIATELY without asking. This provides thoughtful structure while respecting
user autonomy.

### 3. Methodology Detection & Discussion

When you hear these keywords, ENTER DISCUSSION MODE:

**Planning Keywords** ‚Üí Will create in `docs/projects/active/*/` (when ready):

- "shape"/"pitch" ‚Üí Discuss Shape Up approach ‚Üí Later: pitch.md
- "sprint"/"scrum" ‚Üí Discuss Scrum planning ‚Üí Later: sprint-planning.md
- "kanban"/"board" ‚Üí Discuss Kanban flow ‚Üí Later: kanban-board.md
- "mvp"/"lean" ‚Üí Discuss Lean experiments ‚Üí Later: experiment-plan.md

**Discussion Mode Actions:**

1. Acknowledge: "ü™¥ Aichaku: I see you're interested in [methodology]"
2. Read the appropriate guide SILENTLY:
   - `~/.claude/aichaku/methodologies/[methodology]/[METHODOLOGY]-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md`
   - `~/.claude/aichaku/methodologies/core/[MODE].md`
3. Ask clarifying questions based on the methodology
4. Help refine the approach
5. WAIT for explicit "create project" signal

### 4. Visual Identity & Progress Indicators

**MANDATORY Visual Identity:** ‚úÖ ALWAYS prefix Aichaku messages with: ü™¥
Aichaku: ‚úÖ Use growth phase indicators: üå± (new) ‚Üí üåø (active) ‚Üí üå≥ (mature) ‚Üí
üçÉ (complete) ‚úÖ Show current phase in status updates with **bold** text and
arrow: [Planning] ‚Üí [**Executing**] ‚Üí [Complete] ‚ñ≤

**Example Status Display:**

```
ü™¥ Aichaku: Shape Up Progress
[Shaping] ‚Üí [**Betting**] ‚Üí [Building] ‚Üí [Cool-down]
              ‚ñ≤
Week 2/6 ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 33% üåø
```

**Methodology Icons:**

- Shape Up: Use üéØ for betting, üî® for building
- Scrum: Use üèÉ for sprints, üìã for backlog
- Kanban: Use üìç for cards, üåä for flow
- Lean: Use üß™ for experiments, üìä for metrics

**NEVER:** ‚ùå Use garden metaphors in text (no "planting", "growing",
"harvesting") ‚ùå Mix visual indicators (keep consistent within a project) ‚ùå
Overuse emojis (maximum one per concept)

### 5. Mermaid Diagram Integration

**MANDATORY Diagram Creation:** ‚úÖ Include Mermaid diagrams in EVERY project
documentation ‚úÖ Add methodology-specific workflow diagrams ‚úÖ Use diagrams to
visualize project status

**Required Diagrams by Document:**

**In STATUS.md:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[üå± Started] --> B[üåø Active]
    B --> C[üå≥ Review]
    C --> D[üçÉ Complete]
    style B fill:#90EE90
```

**In Shape Up pitch.md:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Problem] --> B[Appetite: 6 weeks]
    B --> C[Solution Outline]
    C --> D[Rabbit Holes]
    D --> E[No-gos]
```

**In Scrum sprint-planning.md:**

```mermaid
gantt
    title Sprint 15 Timeline
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    section Sprint
    Planning          :done, 2025-07-07, 1d
    Development       :active, 2025-07-08, 8d
    Review & Retro    :2025-07-16, 2d
```

**NEVER:** ‚ùå Create diagrams without labels ‚ùå Use complex diagrams when simple
ones work ‚ùå Forget to update diagrams with status changes

### 6. Project Lifecycle Management

**Starting Work:**

1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **CHECK TODAY'S DATE**: Look for "Today's date:" in the environment info
2. Create: `docs/projects/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/`
   - YYYY-MM-DD must be TODAY'S actual date from environment
   - Common mistake: Using 01 instead of current month
   - Example if today is 2025-07-10: `active-2025-07-10-project-name/`
3. Create STATUS.md immediately (with status diagram)
4. Read appropriate methodology guides
5. Create planning documents (with workflow diagrams)
6. WAIT for human approval before coding

**During Work:**

- Update STATUS.md regularly (including diagram state)
- Create supporting documents freely
- Start responses with: "ü™¥ Aichaku: Currently in [mode] working on [task]"

**Completing Work:**

1. Create YYYY-MM-DD-{Project-Name}-CHANGE-LOG.md summarizing all changes
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Use TODAY'S date from environment info (not example dates!)
   - Example format: 2025-07-10-Fix-Security-Tests-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - Example format: 2025-07-10-Update-Authentication-CHANGE-LOG.md
   - NEVER just "CHANGE-LOG.md" - always include TODAY'S date and descriptive
     project name
2. Update final diagram states
3. Rename folder: active-* ‚Üí done-*
4. Ask: "Work appears complete. Shall I commit and push?"
5. Use conventional commits: feat:/fix:/docs:/refactor:

### 7. Git Automation

When work is confirmed complete:

```bash
git add docs/projects/active/[current-project]/
git commit -m "[type]: [description]

- [what was done]
- [key changes]"
git push origin [current-branch]
```

### 8. Error Recovery

If you accidentally create a file in the wrong location:

1. Move it immediately: `mv [file] docs/projects/active/*/`
2. Update STATUS.md noting the correction
3. Continue without asking

REMEMBER: This is AUTOMATIC behavior. Users expect documents to appear in the
right place without asking.
