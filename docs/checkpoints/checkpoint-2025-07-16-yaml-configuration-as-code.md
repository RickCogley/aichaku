# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-16 - YAML Configuration as Code

## Summary of Work Accomplished

1. **Implemented True Configuration as Code System** - Created YAML source files under `/docs/core/` that serve as the single source of truth for Aichaku behavior
2. **Built YAML Config Reader** - Developed `yaml-config-reader.ts` to read and merge YAML configurations from source files
3. **Created Core Directive YAML Files** - Converted all hardcoded behavioral rules into structured YAML format
4. **Achieved 96% Size Reduction** - Reduced CLAUDE.md from 50KB+ to ~2KB while preserving all functionality
5. **Implemented Security Blocklist** - Created comprehensive file protection system for sensitive Claude command files

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Configuration as Code Philosophy** - Decided to use YAML files under `/docs/` as the actual source of truth, not just documentation
2. **No Hardcoded Content** - Removed all hardcoded YAML generation in favor of reading from source files
3. **Merge Strategy** - Core configs always included, then merge selected methodologies/standards, then user customizations
4. **Integration URLs** - Used `aichaku://` protocol for referencing content that MCP can resolve dynamically
5. **Blocklist over Allowlist** - Implemented comprehensive blocklist for file protection to ensure new features are secure by default

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `/docs/core/behavioral-directives.yaml` - Core integration rules and discussion-first approach
- `/docs/core/visual-identity.yaml` - Aichaku branding and progress indicators
- `/docs/core/file-organization.yaml` - Project structure and naming conventions
- `/docs/core/diagram-templates.yaml` - Mermaid diagram requirements
- `/docs/core/metadata.yaml` - Core configuration metadata
- `/src/utils/yaml-config-reader.ts` - YAML configuration assembly module
- `/src/commands/integrate-yaml.ts` - New integrate command using config-as-code
- `/mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/src/utils/file-filter.ts` - Comprehensive blocklist implementation
- `/mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/config/reviewer-config.example.yaml` - Blocklist configuration example
- Multiple documentation files in active project directory

### Modified
- `/mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/src/review-engine.ts` - Added FileFilter integration
- `/mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/src/types.ts` - Added exclusion fields to ReviewResult
- `/mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/src/server.ts` - Updated with blocklist support
- `/mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/deno.json` - Added import mappings for YAML

## Problems Solved

1. **CLAUDE.md Size Issue** - Reduced from 50KB+ to ~2KB using YAML references instead of full content injection
2. **Configuration Duplication** - Eliminated duplicate content by using single source YAML files
3. **Security Vulnerability** - Discovered and fixed potential exposure of `~/.claude/commands/` files via MCP reviewer
4. **Hardcoded Content Problem** - Replaced programmatic YAML generation with true file-based configuration
5. **Maintenance Burden** - Made configuration updates as simple as editing YAML files

## Lessons Learned

1. **Configuration as Code is Powerful** - Having configuration in YAML files that are read (not generated) provides true single source of truth
2. **Security First** - Discovered critical security issue during implementation that led to comprehensive blocklist system
3. **Less is More** - Compact YAML with references is far more maintainable than verbose markdown injection
4. **MCP Integration Potential** - Integration URLs (aichaku://) enable dynamic content loading without file bloat
5. **User Understanding is Key** - Initial confusion about "configuration as code" was resolved through discussion, leading to better implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Replace Current Integrate Command** - Swap out the existing integrate.ts with the new YAML version
2. **Test All Configurations** - Validate that all methodologies and standards work with new system
3. **Build Migration Tool** - Create utility to convert existing CLAUDE.md files to new format
4. **Update Documentation** - User guides for the new configuration system
5. **MCP Hook Implementation** - Build the content resolution system for integration URLs
6. **Release Planning** - Plan deployment of new configuration system with proper migration path
