# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-20 - Nagare PostHook Fix

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- **Fixed critical nagare postRelease hook failure** - Binary upload automation was broken during releases
- **Updated all project dependencies** - Synchronized @std/\* packages across main project and MCP servers
- **Completed comprehensive preflight validation** - All formatting, type checking, linting, and tests passed
- **Identified root cause through comparative analysis** - Manual `deno task build:upload` worked while automated hook
  failed

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Aligned automated and manual workflows** - Changed postRelease hook to use same build process as manual command
- **Maintained error-tolerant release process** - PostRelease failures don't block the main release (continues anyway)
- **Preserved build-then-upload sequence** - Ensured binaries are built fresh before packaging and uploading
- **Updated to latest stable dependencies** - All @std/\* packages updated to current versions for improved JSR
  publishing

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-20-nagare-posthook-fix.md` - This checkpoint documentation

### Modified

- `deno.json` - Updated @std/\* dependencies to latest versions (semver 1.0.5, cli 1.0.20, fs 1.0.19, etc.)
- `mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/deno.json` - Updated @std/\* dependencies including yaml 1.0.8
- `mcp/github-mcp-server/deno.json` - Updated @std/\* dependencies for GitHub integration
- `nagare.config.ts` - **Critical fix**: Changed postRelease hook from `package-and-upload.ts` to
  `build-binaries.ts --upload`
- `deno.lock` - Automatically updated to reflect new dependency versions

## Problems Solved

- **Binary upload automation failure** - PostRelease hook was trying to package non-existent binaries
  - **Root cause**: Hook called `scripts/package-and-upload.ts` which only packages existing files
  - **Solution**: Changed to `scripts/build-binaries.ts --upload` which builds then uploads
- **Dependency version drift** - Multiple @std/\* packages were outdated across project components
  - **Solution**: Systematically updated all packages to latest compatible versions
- **Process alignment gap** - Manual and automated workflows used different scripts
  - **Solution**: Both now use the same build-and-upload process

## Lessons Learned

- **Automation requires complete workflows** - Packaging scripts need the full build context, not just final steps
- **Manual testing validates automation** - The working `deno task build:upload` revealed the correct process
- **Dependency synchronization matters** - MCP servers needed same @std/\* versions as main project for consistency
- **Error analysis through comparison** - Comparing working vs failing processes quickly identified the discrepancy

## Next Steps

- **Validate the fix** - Next release should successfully auto-upload binaries via postRelease hook
- **Monitor JSR publishing improvements** - Nagare 2.13.1 should provide more robust JSR publishing
- **Consider build caching** - Future optimization could cache binaries between build and package steps
- **Document workflow alignment** - Ensure future changes maintain consistency between manual and automated processes
