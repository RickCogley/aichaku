# Checkpoint 2025-07-17: Aichaku Upgrade Fixes and Complete Architecture Consolidation

## Session Overview

This checkpoint documents the comprehensive fixes applied to resolve upgrade command failures, complete the transition
to unified configuration architecture, and eliminate all legacy file formats from the Aichaku project.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Upgrade Command Breaking After Config Consolidation

**Problem**: The upgrade command was inadvertently deleting the main `aichaku.json` file during metadata preservation,
causing "No installation found" errors after users ran `aichaku upgrade`.

**Root Cause**: Spread operator was missing in upgrade metadata preservation (src/commands/upgrade.ts:76-83), causing
only specific fields to be preserved while losing critical configuration data including standards.

**Solution**: Added spread operator to preserve all existing metadata fields:

```typescript
metadata = {
  ...rawMetadata, // Preserve all existing fields (including standards)
  version: rawMetadata.version || metadataInfo.version || VERSION,
  installedAt: rawMetadata.installedAt || rawMetadata.createdAt ||
    new Date().toISOString(),
  installationType: rawMetadata.installationType ||
    (isGlobal ? "global" : "local"),
  lastUpgrade: rawMetadata.lastUpgrade || null,
};
```

### 2. Complete Legacy File Format Purge

**Legacy File Evolution Timeline**:

```text
2024: .aichaku-standards.json          # Original format
2025: .aichaku-standards.json → standards.json + doc-standards.json  # Split format
2025: All formats → aichaku.json       # Unified format (current)
```

**Files Completely Eliminated**:

- `.aichaku-standards.json` - Original standards config
- `aichaku-standards.json` - Development standards variant
- `standards.json` - Intermediate separate standards file ⭐ **CONFIRMED PURGED**
- `doc-standards.json` - Separate documentation standards file
- `.aichaku-doc-standards.json` - Legacy documentation standards

### 3. Architecture Specification Implementation: "All Methodologies, Selected Standards"

**Specification**: "All methodologies, selected standards" with methodologies auto-discovered globally

**Implementation Changes**:

#### MCP Methodology Manager (Fixed)

- **Before**: Read methodologies from per-project configuration files
- **After**: Auto-discover all methodologies globally from `~/.claude/aichaku/docs/methodologies/`
- **Result**: 6 methodologies discovered automatically (scrum, lean, shape-up, scrumban, kanban, xp)

#### Standards Architecture (Maintained)

- **Standards**: Remain per-project selection stored in `.claude/aichaku/aichaku.json`
- **User Experience**: No more `.yaml` extension requirements (normalized automatically)

### 4. Dynamic Content Discovery Implementation

- Replaced hardcoded file lists in content-fetcher.ts with GitHub API-based discovery
- Uses GitHub tree endpoint to dynamically detect available files
- Implements true "configuration as code" philosophy
- Fixes issue where moved files (like SHAPE-UP-ADAPTIVE.md) caused upgrade failures

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Dynamic Content Discovery Architecture

**Decision**: Use GitHub API tree endpoint for runtime file discovery **Rationale**:

- Eliminates maintenance burden of hardcoded file lists
- Automatically adapts when files are moved/renamed
- True "configuration as code" implementation
- Fallback to hardcoded structure only if API fails

### 2. Config File Naming Standard

**Decision**: Standardize on `aichaku.json` (not `aichaku.config.json`) **Rationale**:

- 40 references already use aichaku.json vs only 10 using aichaku.config.json
- Simpler, cleaner naming convention
- ConfigManager already expects this name

### 3. Build Process Discovery

**Decision**: Use deno.json tasks (build, build:upload) instead of manual compilation **Rationale**:

- Proper binary naming with versions
- Includes MCP server builds
- Automated GitHub release uploads
- Consistent with project standards

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-17-aichaku-upgrade-fixes.md` - This checkpoint

### Modified

- `src/commands/content-fetcher.ts` - Implemented fetchGitHubStructureDynamically()
- `src/paths.ts` - Fixed project config path from aichaku.config.json to aichaku.json
- `src/utils/config-manager.ts` - Updated legacy file lists to include aichaku.config.json
- `version.ts` - Updated by Nagare for v0.31.0 and v0.31.2 releases
- `deno.lock` - Updated dependencies

## Problems Solved

### 1. SHAPE-UP-ADAPTIVE.md Upgrade Failure

**Problem**: File was moved to docs/ but hardcoded list still referenced it **Solution**: Dynamic content discovery
using GitHub API

### 2. Config File Naming Confusion

**Problem**: Inconsistent references to aichaku.config.json vs aichaku.json **Solution**: Standardized all references to
aichaku.json

### 3. Manual Binary Upload Issues

**Problem**: Incorrect binary naming, missing MCP servers **Solution**: Used proper build:upload task from deno.json

## Comprehensive Testing Results

### Test Environment Verification

````bash
# Clean test in /tmp/aichaku-test
$ aichaku standards --add "custom:company-style"
✅ Added custom standard custom:company-style
✅ Updated project configuration (1 standards)

$ find . -name "*.json"
./.claude/aichaku/aichaku.json  # Only unified format created

$ aichaku integrate
✅ Integration complete!
📚 Methodologies available: 6  # Auto-discovered globally

$ cat ./.claude/aichaku/aichaku.json

```json
{
  "version": "0.32.0",
  "installedAt": "2025-07-17T12:06:16.049Z",
  "installationType": "local",
  "lastUpgrade": null,
  "standards": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "selected": ["custom:company-style"],
    "customStandards": { ... }
  }
}
````

### Legacy File Prevention

- ✅ **No `standards.json` files created**
- ✅ **No `aichaku-standards.json` files created**
- ✅ **No `.aichaku-standards.json` files created**
- ✅ **Only unified `aichaku.json` format used**

### Dynamic Discovery Validation

```bash
$ deno run --allow-read --allow-env /tmp/test_discovery.ts
Searching in: /Users/rcogley/.claude/aichaku
Discovered methodologies: [ "scrum", "lean", "shape-up", "scrumban", "kanban", "xp" ]
Total count: 6
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Incomplete Work Has Cascading Effects

Yesterday's "completed" config naming fix was actually incomplete, causing today's issues. Thorough verification is
essential.

### 2. Build Automation is Critical

Manual processes (compiling binaries, version bumps) are error-prone. Always use established build tasks.

### 3. Dynamic Discovery > Hardcoded Lists

Hardcoded file lists become technical debt immediately. Dynamic discovery adapts automatically to changes.

### 4. Test the Full User Journey

We discovered issues by walking through the complete upgrade process as a user would experience it.

### 5. Version.ts is Generated

Never manually edit version.ts - it's generated by Nagare and manual edits break the release process.

## Files Modified

### Core Architecture Files

- `src/commands/upgrade.ts` - Critical metadata preservation fix
- `src/commands/standards.ts` - Unified config format, ID normalization
- `src/commands/integrate.ts` - Global methodology discovery
- `src/utils/path-security.ts` - Fixed JSR import paths
- `mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/src/methodology-manager.ts` - Architecture fix for global discovery
- `mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/src/standards-manager.ts` - Consolidated format support
- `scripts/build-binaries.ts` - Automated binary cleanup (freed 18GB)

### Legacy Reference Analysis

**287 references** to legacy file formats found across codebase:

- Migration code (intentionally preserved for backward compatibility)
- Test files (testing migration scenarios)
- Documentation (historical references)
- Comments and strings (not active code paths)

**Status**: All active code paths now use unified format. Legacy references remain only for migration compatibility and
historical documentation.

## Security and Compliance

- All file operations use `safeReadTextFile()` and `validatePath()`
- Prevented directory traversal in config operations
- Maintained principle of least privilege for file permissions
- Atomic config updates prevent partial corruption

## Impact Assessment

### User Experience Improvements

- **Single source of truth**: All configuration in one `aichaku.json` file
- **Friction reduction**: No more `.yaml` extension requirements for standards
- **Automatic discovery**: New methodologies picked up without configuration

### Architecture Benefits

- **Simplified system**: One config format vs. 5+ legacy formats
- **Clear boundaries**: Standards (per-project) vs. Methodologies (global)
- **Reduced complexity**: Global discovery vs. per-project methodology management

### Performance Gains

- **Disk space**: 18GB freed from automated binary cleanup
- **Discovery speed**: Single global scan vs. multiple file checks
- **Deployment**: Cleaner releases without legacy file baggage

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Architecture Consolidation Goals Achieved

1. ✅ **All legacy formats purged** (`standards.json`, `aichaku-standards.json`, etc.)
2. ✅ **Unified configuration** (single `aichaku.json` format)
3. ✅ **Architecture specification implemented** ("all methodologies, selected standards")
4. ✅ **Dynamic discovery working** (6 methodologies auto-discovered)
5. ✅ **User experience improved** (no `.yaml` extension requirements)
6. ✅ **Clean installations verified** (no legacy file creation)

### Ready for Release v0.32.0
