# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-17 - Aichaku Upgrade Fixes

## Summary of Work Accomplished

### 1. Implemented Dynamic Content Discovery

- Replaced hardcoded file lists in content-fetcher.ts with GitHub API-based
  discovery
- Uses GitHub tree endpoint to dynamically detect available files
- Implements true "configuration as code" philosophy
- Fixes issue where moved files (like SHAPE-UP-ADAPTIVE.md) caused upgrade
  failures

### 2. Fixed Config File Naming Inconsistencies

- Discovered 10 references using wrong filename (aichaku.config.json vs
  aichaku.json)
- Fixed paths.ts to use correct aichaku.json naming
- Updated config-manager.ts to treat aichaku.config.json as legacy file
- Ensured consistent naming throughout codebase

### 3. Released Multiple Versions

- v0.31.0: Initial release with dynamic content discovery
- v0.31.1: Attempted manual version bump (reverted - incorrect approach)
- v0.31.2: Proper release with all fixes via Nagare

### 4. Discovered Remaining Upgrade Issues

- Upgrade command still fails looking for .aichaku.json instead of aichaku.json
- findMetadataPath() in upgrade-fix.ts needs updating

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Dynamic Content Discovery Architecture

**Decision**: Use GitHub API tree endpoint for runtime file discovery
**Rationale**:

- Eliminates maintenance burden of hardcoded file lists
- Automatically adapts when files are moved/renamed
- True "configuration as code" implementation
- Fallback to hardcoded structure only if API fails

### 2. Config File Naming Standard

**Decision**: Standardize on `aichaku.json` (not `aichaku.config.json`)
**Rationale**:

- 40 references already use aichaku.json vs only 10 using aichaku.config.json
- Simpler, cleaner naming convention
- ConfigManager already expects this name

### 3. Build Process Discovery

**Decision**: Use deno.json tasks (build, build:upload) instead of manual
compilation **Rationale**:

- Proper binary naming with versions
- Includes MCP server builds
- Automated GitHub release uploads
- Consistent with project standards

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-17-aichaku-upgrade-fixes.md` - This
  checkpoint

### Modified

- `src/commands/content-fetcher.ts` - Implemented
  fetchGitHubStructureDynamically()
- `src/paths.ts` - Fixed project config path from aichaku.config.json to
  aichaku.json
- `src/utils/config-manager.ts` - Updated legacy file lists to include
  aichaku.config.json
- `version.ts` - Updated by Nagare for v0.31.0 and v0.31.2 releases
- `deno.lock` - Updated dependencies

## Problems Solved

### 1. SHAPE-UP-ADAPTIVE.md Upgrade Failure

**Problem**: File was moved to docs/ but hardcoded list still referenced it
**Solution**: Dynamic content discovery using GitHub API

### 2. Config File Naming Confusion

**Problem**: Inconsistent references to aichaku.config.json vs aichaku.json
**Solution**: Standardized all references to aichaku.json

### 3. Manual Binary Upload Issues

**Problem**: Incorrect binary naming, missing MCP servers **Solution**: Used
proper build:upload task from deno.json

## Problems Still Pending

### 1. Upgrade Command Metadata Detection

**Issue**: Looking for .aichaku.json instead of aichaku.json **Location**:
src/commands/upgrade-fix.ts line 24 **Fix Needed**: Update possiblePaths array
to include aichaku.json

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Incomplete Work Has Cascading Effects

Yesterday's "completed" config naming fix was actually incomplete, causing
today's issues. Thorough verification is essential.

### 2. Build Automation is Critical

Manual processes (compiling binaries, version bumps) are error-prone. Always use
established build tasks.

### 3. Dynamic Discovery > Hardcoded Lists

Hardcoded file lists become technical debt immediately. Dynamic discovery adapts
automatically to changes.

### 4. Test the Full User Journey

We discovered issues by walking through the complete upgrade process as a user
would experience it.

### 5. Version.ts is Generated

Never manually edit version.ts - it's generated by Nagare and manual edits break
the release process.

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. Fix findMetadataPath() to look for aichaku.json (not .aichaku.json)
2. Test complete upgrade process again
3. Ensure all four projects can be upgraded successfully

### Future Improvements

1. Add integration tests for upgrade command
2. Consider manifest.json generation for faster discovery
3. Improve error messages when config files aren't found
4. Add validation to prevent config naming inconsistencies

### Process Improvements

1. Always run full upgrade test before releasing
2. Use grep to verify all instances of a pattern are fixed
3. Document expected file names in code comments
4. Consider pre-commit hooks for consistency checks
