# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-25 -

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- Fixed pre-commit hook to only format staged files instead of entire codebase
- Updated stage_changes function to handle specific file lists for targeted staging
- Removed "Next Review" field from checkpoint-2025-07-24-comprehensive-analysis.md
- Made checkpoint slash command deterministic with strict template constraints
- Tested improved pre-commit hook behavior with sample commits

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Staged-file-only formatting**: Modified pre-commit hooks to process only files originally staged for commit to
  prevent unintended staging of unrelated files
- **Template determinism**: Added explicit constraints to checkpoint slash command template to prevent manual additions
  and ensure consistent output format

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-25-test-deterministic-behavior.md` - Test checkpoint to verify improved slash
  command behavior

### Modified

- `.githooks/hooks.d/10-format-code` - Updated to only format files that were originally staged
- `.githooks/lib/common.sh` - Enhanced stage_changes function to accept specific file lists
- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-24-comprehensive-analysis.md` - Removed inappropriate "Next Review" field
- `/Users/rcogley/.claude/commands/aichaku/checkpoint.md` - Added strict constraints to prevent non-deterministic
  behavior

## Problems Solved

- **Pre-commit hook overreach**: Resolved issue where formatting hooks staged unrelated files by limiting scope to
  originally staged files only
- **Non-deterministic checkpoint creation**: Eliminated random additions like review dates and analyst metadata by
  enforcing exact template structure
- **Git workflow unpredictability**: Fixed unexpected unstaged changes appearing after commits due to whole-codebase
  formatting

## Lessons Learned

- Pre-commit hooks must be carefully scoped to avoid unintended file staging
- Template constraints are essential for deterministic output from slash commands
- Historical snapshots (checkpoints) should not include review schedules or living document metadata

## Next Steps

- Monitor pre-commit hook behavior across different commit scenarios
- Verify that future checkpoint creation follows the new deterministic template
- Consider applying similar determinism improvements to other slash commands
