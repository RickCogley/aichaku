# Session Checkpoint - 2025-01-15 - YAML Integration Redesign

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- Designed comprehensive YAML-based integration system to replace verbose Markdown injection
- Created Shape Up pitch document outlining 90%+ file size reduction for CLAUDE.md
- Developed detailed technical implementation plan with 6-week timeline
- Documented decision to unify `docs-standard` into `standards` command
- Established `.yaml` as standard extension for all Aichaku content
- Created task specification for MCP reviewer blocklist feature
- Analyzed current CLI implementation and proposed dynamic configuration-as-code approach

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Compact YAML Block**: Replace 50KB+ Markdown injection with ~2KB YAML configuration
2. **Command Unification**: Merge `docs-standard` into `standards` to eliminate 40% code duplication
3. **Dynamic Categories**: Use filesystem discovery instead of hardcoded category lists
4. **Learn Command**: Rename `help` to `learn` to avoid confusion with `--help` flag
5. **YAML Extension**: Use `.yaml` consistently (26 existing files) vs `.yml` (GitHub only)
6. **Configuration as Code**: All CLI screens and content generated dynamically from YAML metadata
7. **Integration URLs**: Use `aichaku://` protocol for Claude to reference content

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/projects/active/2025-01-15-yaml-integration-redesign/STATUS.md` - Project status tracking
- `docs/projects/active/2025-01-15-yaml-integration-redesign/pitch.md` - Shape Up pitch document
- `docs/projects/active/2025-01-15-yaml-integration-redesign/technical-plan.md` - Implementation details
- `docs/projects/active/2025-01-15-yaml-integration-redesign/mcp-reviewer-blocklist-task.md` - Feature task

### Modified

- `CLAUDE.md` - Added methodologies quick reference YAML section for testing
- (Analysis only, no modifications to source files yet)

## Problems Solved

1. **File Size Issue**: Designed solution reducing CLAUDE.md from 50KB+ to ~2KB
2. **Code Duplication**: Identified path to eliminate duplicate standards/docs-standard commands
3. **Hardcoded Lists**: Discovered existing `dynamic-content-discovery.ts` already supports dynamic categories
4. **Extension Confusion**: Analyzed and resolved `.yaml` vs `.yml` convention question
5. **Content Distribution**: Clarified that aichaku downloads from GitHub, doesn't bundle in binary

## Lessons Learned

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: The codebase already has dynamic discovery utilities that can be leveraged
2. **Dual Distribution Model**: Aichaku smartly uses GitHub downloads for production, local files for development
3. **YAML-First Design**: Rich metadata already exists in YAML files but is underutilized
4. **Configuration Over Code**: Moving from hardcoded constants to dynamic YAML loading enables true extensibility
5. **Migration Importance**: Auto-migration is critical for user adoption of new format

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1 Implementation**: Begin command unification and dynamic category discovery
2. **Test YAML Block Detection**: Implement and test the YAML block parser
3. **Create Migration System**: Build automatic migration for existing CLAUDE.md files
4. **Update Help Command**: Rename to `learn` and make content dynamic
5. **Claude Testing**: Verify Claude can parse the compact YAML format
6. **Performance Benchmarks**: Measure parse time improvements with smaller files
7. **Documentation Updates**: Update all help text and user guides
