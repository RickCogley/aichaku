# Session Checkpoint: 2025-01-11 - Security Fixes and Repository Migrations

## Session Overview

This session focused on fixing critical path traversal security vulnerabilities in the MCP server, creating a new
release (v0.21.1), and migrating multiple repositories to the new aichaku v0.21.1 structure.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Security Vulnerability Fixes

- **Fixed 30+ path traversal vulnerabilities** across the MCP server codebase
- Created comprehensive security utilities in `src/utils/path-security.ts`
- Systematically replaced all unsafe file operations with secure alternatives
- User quote: "If it's possible to exploit I would rather not be responsible for that! A thorough fix is best."

### 2. Release v0.21.1

- Created new release including all security fixes
- Built and uploaded MCP binaries for all platforms
- Fixed build script bug that was causing path validation errors
- Successfully published to GitHub with all binaries included

### 3. Repository Migrations

Successfully migrated four repositories to the new aichaku structure:

#### Aichaku (this repository)

- Already on new structure
- Updated to v0.21.1
- Selected standards: OWASP, NIST-CSF, TDD, CONVENTIONAL-COMMITS, SOLID, DIATAXIS-GOOGLE

#### Nagare

- Migrated from old to new structure
- Selected standards appropriate for a release management tool
- User wanted to add standards themselves to learn the process

#### Salty

- Migrated successfully
- Selected lean standards for stateless encryption service:
  - OWASP, NIST-CSF, TDD, CONVENTIONAL-COMMITS, SOLID, DIATAXIS-GOOGLE
- Cleaned up old files after migration

#### Dotfiles

- Migrated to new structure
- Selected appropriate standards for configuration management
- Used manual migration script

### 4. MCP Server Updates

- Compiled latest MCP server with security fixes
- Updated global MCP server binary to latest version
- Verified installation and functionality

## Key Technical Elements

### Path Security Implementation

Created `src/utils/path-security.ts` with comprehensive validation:

```typescript
export function validatePath(userPath: string, baseDir: string): string {
  const absoluteBase = resolve(baseDir);
  const normalizedPath = normalize(userPath);
  const fullPath = resolve(absoluteBase, normalizedPath);

  if (!fullPath.startsWith(absoluteBase)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid path: attempted directory traversal");
  }

  return fullPath;
}
```

### Manual Migration Script

Created `manual-migrate.sh` to handle migrations since `aichaku migrate` has placeholder implementation.

### New Directory Structure

```text
.claude/
├── aichaku/           # New aichaku-specific files
│   ├── standards.json
│   ├── doc-standards.json
│   └── aichaku.config.json
├── output/            # User work (preserved)
├── user/              # User customizations (preserved)
├── sessions/          # Session history (preserved)
└── settings.local.json # Local settings (preserved)
```

## User Corrections and Feedback

1. **MCP binaries missing**: "by the way, the mcp binary files are not included with the last release, but they should
   be included each time"
2. **aichaku standards command**: "FYI, aichaku standards alone does not work, you have to add --show"
3. **Migration awareness**: User remembered `aichaku migrate` exists when I didn't mention it
4. **Documentation standards**: User corrected that there's a combined standard called "diataxis-google"

## Current Status

- ✅ All security vulnerabilities fixed
- ✅ v0.21.1 released with fixes
- ✅ All repositories migrated to new structure
- ✅ MCP server updated with latest security fixes
- ✅ Documentation up to date

## Pending Items

1. Fix `aichaku migrate` command (currently placeholder implementation)
2. Implement documentation generation feature (`--generate` flag)
3. Add version information to `aichaku mcp --status`
4. Add stop/restart commands for MCP server management

## Next Steps

User wants to:

1. Generate comprehensive project documentation in `/docs` for each migrated repository
2. Ensure all projects are using the updated MCP server
3. Understand how to trigger documentation generation for entire projects

## Commands Reference

```bash
# MCP Server Management
aichaku mcp --status
aichaku mcp --install
pkill -f mcp-code-reviewer  # Stop server
ps aux | grep mcp-code-reviewer | grep -v grep  # Check if running

# Documentation Generation (pending implementation)
aichaku docs-standard --show
aichaku docs:lint --generate  # Not yet implemented
```
