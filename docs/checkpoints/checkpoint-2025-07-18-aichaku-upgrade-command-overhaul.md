# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-18 - Aichaku Upgrade Command Overhaul

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- **Transformed upgrade command user experience** - From "black box" to transparent, informative process
- **Fixed critical upgrade command issues** - Missing metadata files, legacy file cleanup, behavioral guidance
  preservation
- **Implemented comprehensive location context** - Users now see exactly WHERE files are installed/updated
- **Added standards configuration migration** - Preserves legacy standards during upgrades
- **Fixed standards discovery system** - Built-in standards now properly discoverable from global installation
- **Cleaned up legacy metadata fields** - Removes obsolete fields like globalVersion, createdAt, customizations
- **Enhanced visual feedback** - Clear progress indicators, file counts, directory trees, next steps guidance

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Location context over silent operations** - Every upgrade now shows precise file locations and counts
- **Migration before cleanup** - Read and preserve legacy configurations before deleting old files
- **Behavioral guidance preservation** - .aichaku-behavior files are active resources, not legacy cleanup targets
- **Standards path correction** - Standards discovery uses global Aichaku path, not current working directory
- **Legacy field cleanup** - Remove obsolete metadata fields to prevent user confusion
- **Visual guidance framework integration** - Leverage existing utilities for consistent upgrade messaging

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/projects/active/active-2025-07-17-contextual-guidance-implementation/pitch.md` - Shape Up project planning for
  contextual guidance
- `docs/projects/active/active-2025-07-17-contextual-guidance-implementation/STATUS.md` - Project tracking and
  validation results

### Modified

- `src/commands/upgrade.ts` - Major overhaul with location context, standards migration, legacy cleanup,
  .aichaku-behavior recreation
- `src/commands/standards.ts` - Fixed standards discovery to use global Aichaku installation path
- `scripts/cleanup-global-installation.ts` - Removed .aichaku-behavior from legacy cleanup (preserve active files)
- `cleanup-all-projects.sh` - Removed .aichaku-behavior from duplicate file removal
- `.claude/aichaku/aichaku.json` - Updated through upgrade testing validation
- `.claude/aichaku/.aichaku-behavior` - Recreated through upgrade testing

## Problems Solved

### 1. **Missing Location Context ("Black Box" Problem)**

- **Issue**: Users had no idea WHERE files were installed during upgrades
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive location context with directory trees, file counts, and clear messaging
- **Impact**: Users now see exactly what was updated and where

### 2. **Missing Project Metadata Files**

- **Issue**: Project upgrades weren't creating required aichaku.json files
- **Solution**: Added proper metadata file creation logic for both global and project upgrades
- **Impact**: All projects now have consistent metadata tracking

### 3. **Legacy File Cleanup Issues**

- **Issue**: Inconsistent cleanup of old files, some beneficial files being deleted
- **Solution**: Systematic legacy file detection and cleanup, with preservation of active files
- **Impact**: Clean upgrades without losing important behavioral guidance

### 4. **Standards Configuration Loss**

- **Issue**: Project-specific standards were lost during upgrades from legacy versions
- **Solution**: Read and migrate standards configuration before cleaning up legacy files
- **Impact**: Preserves user's carefully selected standards across upgrades

### 5. **Standards Discovery Failure**

- **Issue**: Standards commands only showed custom standards, not built-in ones
- **Solution**: Fixed discovery path to use global Aichaku installation instead of current directory
- **Impact**: All built-in standards (OWASP, NIST-CSF, TDD, etc.) now properly discoverable

### 6. **Legacy Metadata Field Confusion**

- **Issue**: Obsolete fields like globalVersion showing outdated information
- **Solution**: Automatically clean up legacy metadata fields during upgrades
- **Impact**: Clean, consistent metadata without confusing version information

### 7. **Behavioral Guidance File Loss**

- **Issue**: .aichaku-behavior files were being deleted and not recreated
- **Solution**: Preserve during cleanup and recreate if missing during project upgrades
- **Impact**: Consistent behavioral guidance available for Claude Code

## Lessons Learned

### User Experience Principles

- **Transparency beats efficiency** - Users prefer seeing exactly what happens, even if output is longer
- **Location context is critical** - "What" without "Where" creates confusion and reduces confidence
- **Progressive disclosure works** - Show overview first, then details, then next steps

### Technical Architecture Insights

- **Migration before cleanup** - Always read and preserve data before deleting legacy files
- **Path resolution matters** - Discovery systems must use correct base paths, not assume current directory
- **Legacy compatibility is complex** - Multiple metadata formats and file structures require careful handling
- **Visual feedback frameworks pay off** - Investing in reusable visual guidance utilities enables consistent UX

### Development Process

- **Senior engineer quality standards** - Pre-flight checks (fmt/lint/check/test) prevent release issues
- **Real user testing reveals issues** - Actual upgrade scenarios exposed problems missed in unit testing
- **Systematic problem solving** - Breaking down complex issues into specific, testable components

## Next Steps

### Immediate

- **Test legacy metadata cleanup** - Validate that dotfiles project removes globalVersion field after upgrade
- **Comprehensive standards testing** - Verify standards migration and discovery across all project types
- **Complete project validation** - Test salty and dotfiles projects with new upgrade improvements

### Future Enhancements

- **Rollback functionality** - Ability to revert upgrades if issues occur
- **Upgrade verification** - Post-upgrade validation to ensure all components working correctly
- **Migration reporting** - Detailed reports of what was migrated during complex upgrades
- **Backup creation** - Automatic backups before major upgrades

### Architecture Improvements

- **Unified metadata interface** - Single source of truth for all metadata field definitions
- **Upgrade plugin system** - Modular upgrade steps for easier maintenance and testing
- **Configuration validation** - Ensure all configurations are valid after upgrades
