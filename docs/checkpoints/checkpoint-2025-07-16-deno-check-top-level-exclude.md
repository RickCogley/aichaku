# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-16 - Deno Check Top-Level Exclude Support

## Summary

Based on GitHub issue #26864, discovered that `deno check` DOES support exclusions when:

1. Using top-level `"exclude"` in deno.json (not in a "check" section)
2. Running `deno check` without arguments (not `deno check .`)

This is a significant improvement from the previous understanding that deno check had no exclusion support.

## Key Discovery

As of Deno v2.3.1+, the behavior is:

- `deno check` (no args) → Respects top-level exclude ✅
- `deno check .` → Ignores exclusions ❌
- `deno check **/*.ts` → Ignores exclusions ❌

## Implementation

### 1. Added Top-Level Exclude to deno.json

```json
{
  "exclude": [
    ".claude/",
    "scratch/",
    "version.ts",
    "docs/api/",
    "docs/projects/**/*.ts",
    "examples/**/*.ts",
    "src/commands/*-v2.ts",
    "src/utils/config-manager.ts",
    "src/utils/migration-helper.ts"
  ]
  // ... rest of config
}
```

### 2. Re-enabled Type Checking in Nagare

```typescript
types: [
  "lint",
  "format",
  "security-scan",
  "type-check", // Re-enabled: deno check now respects top-level exclude
  "version-conflict",
],
```

### 3. Updated Pre-Release Hook

Changed from:

```typescript
args: ["check", "**/*.ts"]; // This ignores exclusions
```

To:

```typescript
args: ["check"]; // This respects top-level exclude
```

## Test Results

Created test file with intentional type error in `scratch/test-exclude.ts`:

- Running `deno check` successfully skipped the test file
- Also skipped all v2 files and other excluded paths
- Only reported the known error in config-manager.ts (which is in our exclude list)

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Configuration**: Single source of truth for exclusions
2. **Nagare Compatibility**: Built-in type checking now works correctly
3. **No Workarounds Needed**: Removed the need to disable type checking
4. **Cleaner Pre-Release Hooks**: No need for explicit file lists

## Current Status

✅ Format checking works with exclusions ✅ Lint checking works with exclusions\
✅ Type checking works with exclusions (when using `deno check` without args) ✅ Nagare release process fully functional
with all safety checks enabled
