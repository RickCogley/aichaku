# Checkpoint Summary - 2025-07-14

## Session Overview

Successfully upgraded the Aichaku methodology library from v0.5.0 to v0.16.0 and
designed a comprehensive enhancement suite leveraging Claude Code's new hooks
feature. Created detailed Shape Up documentation for implementing modular
guidance sections, lightweight roles, and automated methodology enforcement
through hooks.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Claude Code Hooks Integration**: Use hooks for automated methodology
  enforcement instead of runtime prompt modification
- **Lightweight Role System**: Implement simple 3x3 matrix (3 work modes Ã— 3
  perspectives) rather than complex AI personas
- **Modular Guidance Architecture**: Extend existing marker system to support
  configurable sections (methodology, security, architecture)
- **Security Documentation Location**: Keep SECURITY_WORKFLOWS.md within
  Aichaku, moving to `.claude/methodologies/security/`

## Files Modified

### Created:

  Project tracking with growth phases
- `.claude/output/active-2025-01-09-aichaku-hooks-integration/pitch.md` -
  Complete Shape Up pitch for enhancements
- `.claude/output/active-2025-01-09-aichaku-hooks-integration/modular-guidance-design.md` -
  Module system architecture
- `.claude/output/active-2025-01-09-aichaku-hooks-integration/security-workflows-analysis.md` -
  Security implementation analysis

### Modified:

- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with Aichaku v0.16.0 integration rules and latest
  methodology guidelines

## Problems Solved

- Designed comprehensive hook integration strategy for Claude Code's new feature
- Created architecture for modular guidance supporting OWASP, ISO 27001,
  15-factor, and custom standards
- Clarified role system confusion (hooks-based, not AI personas)
- Identified approach to make hidden security workflows discoverable

## Next Steps

1. Implement hook templates and `aichaku hooks` command
2. Create modular guidance sections from existing security content
3. Update integrate.ts to support multiple section types
4. Move SECURITY_WORKFLOWS.md to `.claude/methodologies/security/`
5. Test hook integration with real methodology workflows
