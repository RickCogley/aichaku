# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-16 - YAML Documentation Architecture

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- Fixed hardcoded version "2.0.0" in YAML configuration system to use dynamic
  version from version.ts

- Renamed `/docs/methodologies/core/` to `/docs/methodologies/common/` to avoid
  naming ambiguity with `/docs/core/`

- Created comprehensive YAML configuration documentation in proper location
  (`docs/how-to/configure-yaml-directives.md`)

- Streamlined CLAUDE.md by removing redundant documentation and adding reference
  to proper user documentation

- Updated all references across the codebase to reflect the directory rename

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Dynamic Version Injection**: Replaced hardcoded "2.0.0" with VERSION
  constant from version.ts to ensure consistency across the system

- **Directory Naming Convention**: Renamed "core" to "common" within
  methodologies to avoid confusion with system core directives in `/docs/core/`

- **Documentation Architecture**: Moved user-facing YAML configuration
  documentation from CLAUDE.md to `docs/how-to/` where users expect to find it

- **Information Architecture**: Separated Claude Code instructions (CLAUDE.md)
  from user education materials (docs/)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/how-to/configure-yaml-directives.md` - Comprehensive user guide for YAML
  configuration system with examples, troubleshooting, and customization
  instructions

### Modified

- `mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/src/utils/yaml-config-reader.ts` - Replaced hardcoded
  version with dynamic VERSION import

- `CLAUDE.md` - Streamlined by removing redundant YAML documentation and adding
  simple reference link

- Multiple documentation files updated to change references from
  `methodologies/core` to `methodologies/common`:

  - `docs/how-to/configure-project.md`

  - Various project completion and change log files

  - Methodology integration documentation

### Renamed/Restructured

- `/docs/methodologies/core/` â†’ `/docs/methodologies/common/` - Complete
  directory rename with all contained files

## Problems Solved

- **Version Inconsistency**: Fixed hardcoded version numbers that were out of
  sync with actual application version

- **Naming Ambiguity**: Resolved confusion between `/docs/core/` (system
  directives) and `/docs/methodologies/core/` (methodology guidance)

- **Documentation Placement**: Moved user-facing documentation from Claude Code
  instructions to proper user documentation location

- **Information Architecture**: Improved separation between user education and
  AI instruction materials

## Lessons Learned

- **Documentation Placement Matters**: User-facing features should be documented
  in user documentation areas (`docs/how-to/`), not mixed into AI instruction
  files

- **Naming Conventions**: Clear, unambiguous directory names prevent confusion
  and improve developer experience

- **Single Source of Truth**: Dynamic version injection ensures consistency
  across the entire system

- **Architectural Clarity**: Separating user documentation from AI instructions
  improves both maintainability and user experience

## Next Steps

- Monitor hook JSON parsing errors (caused by large CLAUDE.md file) and consider
  optimizations if they become blocking

- Consider further modularization of YAML configuration system based on user
  feedback

- Evaluate opportunities to apply similar documentation architecture
  improvements to other areas

- Potential implementation of automated version consistency checks across the
  codebase
