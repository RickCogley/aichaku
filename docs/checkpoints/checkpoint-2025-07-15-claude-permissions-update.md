# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-15 - Claude Permissions Update

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- Analyzed and sorted 118 permissions from `.claude/settings.local.json` into
  logical categories

- Identified recommended permissions for global configuration

- Updated global settings file with sorted and expanded permissions list

## Key Technical Decisions

- Included all core development tools (Deno, Git, GitHub CLI) in global config

- Added all MCP server permissions for enhanced functionality

- Maintained alphabetical sorting for easier maintenance

- Preserved existing deny list for safety (rm -rf, sudo, killall)

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-15-claude-permissions-update.md` - This
  checkpoint file

### Modified

- `/Users/rcogley/.dotfiles/claude/.claude/settings.json` - Added recommended
  permissions and sorted alphabetically

## Problems Solved

- Consolidated scattered permissions into organized categories

- Identified which permissions should be global vs project-specific

- Improved maintainability with alphabetical sorting

## Lessons Learned

- Project-specific paths and scripts should remain in local settings

- MCP tools provide valuable functionality and should be included globally

- Alphabetical sorting makes large permission lists much easier to manage

## Next Steps

- Consider creating a script to sync common permissions across projects

- Document the purpose of each MCP tool for future reference

- Review and potentially add more safety entries to the deny list
