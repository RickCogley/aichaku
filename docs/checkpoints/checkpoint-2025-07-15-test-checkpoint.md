# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-15 - Test Checkpoint

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- **Fixed the /aichaku:checkpoint slash command** - Restructured command to properly execute bash commands and create
  actual checkpoint files
- **Successfully tested command execution** - Verified that the fixed command now runs correctly with proper Context
  section execution
- **Validated command functionality** - Confirmed that $ARGUMENTS substitution works and bash commands execute as
  expected

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Command Structure**: Moved from template display to executable Context + Your task format following Claude Code
  documentation
- **Bash Execution**: Used `!` prefixed commands in Context section to actually execute and capture system information
- **Variable Handling**: Properly implemented $ARGUMENTS for dynamic checkpoint naming

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-15-test-checkpoint.md - This test checkpoint file

### Modified

- /Users/rcogley/.dotfiles/claude/.claude/commands/aichaku/checkpoint.md - Fixed command structure for proper execution

## Problems Solved

- **Non-executing slash command** - Command was showing template instead of executing actions
- **Missing bash execution** - Added proper `!` prefixed commands to actually run system commands
- **Template vs execution** - Restructured from documentation template to executable command format

## Lessons Learned

- **Slash command structure** - Context section with `!` commands executes before "Your task" instructions
- **Command vs template** - Slash commands should instruct Claude what to do, not just show what should happen
- **Bash integration** - `!` prefixed commands in Context section provide real-time system information

## Next Steps

- **Test with actual session data** - Use the checkpoint command for real work sessions
- **Consider MCP integration** - Monitor if Markdown review MCP affects command files
- **Validate across scenarios** - Test with different argument patterns and longer descriptive names
