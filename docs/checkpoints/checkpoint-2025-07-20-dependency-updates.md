# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-20 - Dependency Updates

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- Updated all Deno standard library imports across three deno.json files to
  latest versions
- Updated nagare build tool from 2.9.1 to 2.13.1 for improved JSR publishing
- Verified MCP SDK was already at latest version (1.15.1)
- Successfully ran comprehensive preflight checks (format, type check, lint,
  test)
- Committed and pushed all dependency updates and related changes

## Key Technical Decisions

- Applied all available patch and minor version updates for @std/\* packages as
  they are considered safe
- Maintained semantic versioning constraints (^x.y.z) to allow future patch
  updates
- Updated nagare specifically for enhanced JSR publishing robustness and
  postRelease hook functionality
- Kept MCP SDK at current version as it was already latest
- Updated all three project components (main, aichaku-mcp-server,
  GitHub-mcp-server) in sync

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- None

### Modified

- `deno.json` - Updated nagare to 2.13.1 and all @std/\* imports to latest
  versions
- `mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/deno.json` - Updated @std/\* dependencies including
  @std/yaml
- `mcp/github-mcp-server/deno.json` - Updated @std/path, @std/fs, @std/crypto
- `deno.lock` - Automatically updated to reflect new dependency versions
- Various documentation files - Auto-formatted during preflight

## Problems Solved

- Ensured all project components use consistent, up-to-date dependency versions
- Eliminated potential security vulnerabilities from outdated standard library
  packages
- Improved build reliability with nagare 2.13.1's enhanced JSR publishing
- Maintained project health through successful preflight validation (36 tests
  passing)

## Lessons Learned

- Systematic dependency checking using `deno info --json` provides accurate
  version information
- Multiple deno.json files across MCP servers require coordinated updates
- Deno's standard library packages are actively maintained with frequent updates
- Preflight checks (fmt, check, lint, test) are essential before committing
  dependency changes

## Next Steps

- Monitor JSR publishing improvements with new nagare version
- Test postRelease hook functionality for automatic binary uploads
- Consider setting up automated dependency update monitoring
- Evaluate impact of updated standard library features on existing code
