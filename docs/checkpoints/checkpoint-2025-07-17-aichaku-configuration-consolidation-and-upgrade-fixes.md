# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-17 - Aichaku Configuration Consolidation and Upgrade Fixes

## Summary of Work Accomplished
- Consolidated aichaku configuration system into unified `aichaku.json` format
- Fixed upgrade command path resolution and JSR detection issues
- Restored hooks functionality with proper aichaku-hooks.ts runner
- Updated integrate command to support unified configuration with legacy fallback
- Created cleanup script for global installation maintenance
- Resolved all preflight checks and committed changes for release

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Unified Configuration**: Consolidated separate `standards.json` and `doc-standards.json` into single `aichaku.json` with combined standards array, simplifying configuration management
- **Path Structure Standardization**: Fixed global paths to use proper `docs/` subdirectory structure (`~/.claude/aichaku/docs/methodologies/`, `~/.claude/aichaku/docs/standards/`)
- **JSR Detection Logic**: Improved compiled binary detection to use JSR fetch instead of local development paths using `!import.meta.url.includes("/aichaku/")`
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained legacy file support in integrate command for smooth migration path
- **Hooks Preservation**: Updated cleanup script to preserve essential `hooks/` directory containing `aichaku-hooks.ts` runner
- **Content Fetcher Targeting**: Fixed fetch calls to use specific content directories instead of root paths

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `scripts/cleanup-global-installation.ts` - Comprehensive cleanup script for global installation maintenance with backup functionality

### Modified
- `.claude/aichaku/aichaku.json` - Consolidated standards configuration from separate files
- `src/commands/integrate.ts` - Updated to read unified configuration with legacy fallback and improved error handling
- `src/commands/upgrade.ts` - Fixed JSR detection and content fetcher paths
- `src/commands/init.ts` - Fixed JSR detection and content fetcher paths
- `src/paths.ts` - Updated global paths to use correct docs/ subdirectory structure
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with latest configuration from integrate command
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Updated with additional allowed bash patterns

### Deleted
- `.claude/aichaku/doc-standards.json` - Consolidated into main aichaku.json
- `.claude/aichaku/standards.json` - Consolidated into main aichaku.json

## Problems Solved
1. **Upgrade Command Failure**: Fixed "aichaku is not found" error by correcting path resolution in upgrade-fix.ts
2. **Configuration Fragmentation**: Eliminated separate standards files causing confusion and maintenance overhead
3. **Global Installation Mess**: Resolved duplicate files in multiple locations with proper directory structure
4. **Hooks System Broken**: Fixed "Module not found" error by restoring and regenerating aichaku-hooks.ts runner
5. **Compiled Binary Issues**: Fixed JSR detection to use proper GitHub fetch instead of local development paths
6. **Content Fetcher Misdirection**: Corrected fetch calls to target specific directories instead of root paths

## Lessons Learned
- **Configuration Consolidation**: Single unified config files are much easier to maintain than multiple separate files
- **Path Management**: Consistent directory structure prevents confusion and makes upgrades more reliable
- **JSR Detection**: Compiled binaries need special handling to distinguish from local development environment
- **Hooks Generation**: The hooks command automatically generates/updates the aichaku-hooks.ts runner, making manual restoration unnecessary
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining legacy support during transitions prevents breaking existing installations
- **Cleanup Safety**: Always create backups before cleanup operations and explicitly preserve essential runtime components

## Next Steps
- Release v0.31.4 with all consolidated fixes
- Upgrade other projects (nagare, etc.) to use new unified configuration system
- Monitor for any edge cases in the unified configuration system
- Consider creating migration tooling for users with legacy configurations
- Evaluate if further cleanup opportunities exist in the global installation structure
