# Checkpoint Summary - 2025-07-14

## Session Overview

Analyzed and organized Claude Code permissions from the Aichaku project's local settings file. Successfully categorized
118 permissions and updated the global configuration file with recommended permissions, maintaining alphabetical sorting
for better maintainability.

## Key Technical Decisions

- Categorized permissions into logical groups (development tools, git operations, CLI tools, etc.)
- Identified universally useful permissions vs project-specific ones
- Added missing essential tools to global config while excluding project-specific paths
- Maintained alphabetical sorting in the global settings for consistency

## Files Modified

- `/Users/rcogley/.dotfiles/claude/.claude/settings.json` - Updated global Claude settings with comprehensive
  permissions including:
  - Shell utilities: bash, curl, mkdir, mv, python3, realpath, rg, tree, awk
  - Complete Deno toolchain: all standard Deno commands including compile, info, publish
  - Git operations: added commit, config, restore to existing commands
  - Full GitHub CLI suite: workflows, runs, releases, API access
  - Claude CLI commands for configuration and hooks
  - All MCP tools (aichaku-reviewer, GitHub-operations, test-formatting)
  - Essential web domains: GitHub.com, jsr.io, modelcontextprotocol.io

## Problems Solved

- Local settings file had 118 unsorted permissions making it difficult to manage
- Global config was missing many essential development tools
- No clear distinction between project-specific and universally useful permissions
- Needed systematic approach to permission management

## Next Steps

- Clean up `.claude/settings.local.json` by removing permissions now in global config
- Remove project-specific git paths (e.g., salty.esolia.pro-dd commands) from local settings
- Consider creating a template for project-specific permissions
- Monitor for any missing permissions during development and add to appropriate config file
