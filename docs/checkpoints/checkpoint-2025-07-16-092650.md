# Checkpoint Summary - 2025-07-16

## Session Overview

Addressed critical performance issues with CLAUDE.md exceeding the 40k character
limit (70.4k chars), causing API errors. Analyzed the YAML configuration system
to identify size reduction opportunities and created a comprehensive plan to
achieve 96% size reduction.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Remove `rules` sections from CLAUDE.md**: Keep detailed rules in source YAML
  files for CLI/deep-dive access
- **Retain only `summary` sections**: These provide essential guidance without
  overwhelming detail
- **Modular YAML approach confirmed**: Standards have three sections - `summary`
  (for CLAUDE.md), `display` (for CLI), `rules` (for detailed access)
- **Size targets established**: All realistic team combinations will stay under
  25k characters

## Files Modified

### Committed Changes:

1. **YAML Configuration Infrastructure** (commit 0ba7b89)
   - `.claude/aichaku/doc-standards.json` - Created
   - `.claude/aichaku/standards.json` - Created
   - `src/utils/yaml-config-reader.ts` - Created
   - `mcp/aichaku-mcp-server/src/utils/config-loader.ts` - Created

2. **Documentation Architecture** (commit 4541921)
   - `docs/core/` - Added 5 YAML configuration files
   - `docs/how-to/configure-yaml-directives.md` - Created
   - `docs/methodologies/common/` - Moved core methodology docs here
   - `docs/checkpoints/` - Added 6 checkpoint files

3. **Methodology Cleanup** (commit f963bae)
   - Removed 15 files from `docs/methodologies/core/` (moved to common/)
   - Removed `docs/methodologies/shape-up/SHAPE-UP-ADAPTIVE.md`

4. **MCP Server Updates** (commit 2ac8128)
   - Enhanced MCP server with new tools and utilities
   - Added test suite and configuration examples

5. **Project Documentation** (commit 96069cd)
   - Updated active project documentation
   - Created comprehensive YAML integration project files

6. **Main Configuration** (commit 7c2f88b)
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with YAML system (still needs size reduction)
   - Created CLAUDE-EXAMPLE.md

### Planning Documents Created:

- `docs/projects/active/active-2025-07-15-yaml-integration-redesign/size-analysis-findings.md`

## Problems Solved

1. **Root Cause Identified**: CLAUDE.md includes both `summary` AND `rules`
   sections, with rules adding ~1,470 lines
2. **Size Projections Calculated**:
   - Current system: 37k-72k chars (exceeds limit for most teams)
   - Enhanced summary system: 18k-23k chars (well under limit for all teams)
3. **Realistic Usage Patterns Analyzed**:
   - Minimal/Startup teams: 3-4 standards
   - Balanced teams: 5-6 standards
   - Enterprise teams: 7-8 standards
   - Nobody needs all 10 standards simultaneously

## Next Steps

1. **Create compact CLAUDE.md** by removing all `rules` sections (in progress)
2. **Test size reduction** to confirm under 40k character limit
3. **Verify functionality** with modular YAML access
4. **Commit final changes** once size is optimized
5. **Consider enhancing summaries** to include essential principles without full
   rules detail

---

**Status**: Planning complete, implementation of compact CLAUDE.md pending. The
YAML configuration system is successfully reducing complexity while maintaining
full functionality through modular access.
