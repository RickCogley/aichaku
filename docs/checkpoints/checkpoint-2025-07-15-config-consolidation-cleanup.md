# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-15 - Configuration Consolidation and Cleanup

## Summary of Work Accomplished

1. **Completed Methodology Migration**
   - Moved all methodology files from `/methodologies/` to `/docs/methodologies/`
   - Distributed YAML files to sit alongside their corresponding MD files
   - Removed empty `/methodologies/` directory from root

2. **Renamed Methodology Guide Files**
   - Changed verbose names like `KANBAN-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md` to simple `kanban.md`
   - Updated all references in YAML files, source code, and documentation
   - Achieved consistent naming convention across all methodologies

3. **Fixed Runtime Paths in YAML Files**
   - Updated all standards YAML files to use `~/.claude/aichaku/docs/standards/...`
   - Updated all methodology YAML files to use `~/.claude/aichaku/docs/methodologies/...`
   - Added proper `learn_more` sections with both docs URLs and local paths

4. **Cleaned Up Configuration Files**
   - Removed old config files: `aichaku-standards.json`, `aichaku.config.json`, `standards.json`
   - Removed hidden redundant files: `.aichaku-project`, `.aichaku.json`, `.aichaku-behavior`
   - Converted `RULES-REMINDER.md` to `rules-reminder.yaml` for efficient machine reading
   - Kept only essential files: `aichaku.json` and `rules-reminder.yaml`

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Single Configuration File**: Consolidated all metadata into `aichaku.json` to reduce complexity and improve
   maintainability

2. **Consistent Naming**: Simplified methodology guide filenames to match their directory names (e.g.,
   `kanban/kanban.md`)

3. **Runtime Path Strategy**: All YAML files now reference runtime locations at `~/.claude/aichaku/docs/...` instead of
   source paths

4. **Machine-Readable Rules**: Converted rules reminder to YAML format for more efficient parsing by Claude

5. **Documentation Under /docs**: Maintained all documentation under `/docs/` for GitHub Pages compatibility

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `/docs/methodologies/archive/` (moved from root)
- `/docs/methodologies/*/[methodology].yaml` (6 files moved from `/methodologies/yaml/`)
- `/.claude/aichaku/rules-reminder.yaml` (converted from Markdown)
- `/docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-15-config-consolidation-cleanup.md` (this file)

### Modified

- All standards YAML files (updated runtime paths)
- All methodology YAML files (updated runtime paths and added learn_more sections)
- `src/lister.ts` (updated to use simplified filenames)
- `src/commands/integrate.ts` (updated reference in comments)
- `src/commands/content-fetcher.ts` (updated hardcoded filenames)

### Renamed

- `KANBAN-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md` → `kanban.md`
- `LEAN-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md` → `lean.md`
- `SCRUM-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md` → `scrum.md`
- `SCRUMBAN-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md` → `scrumban.md`
- `SHAPE-UP-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md` → `shape-up.md`
- `XP-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md` → `xp.md`

### Deleted

- `/methodologies/` directory (entire tree)
- `/.claude/aichaku/aichaku-standards.json`
- `/.claude/aichaku/aichaku.config.json`
- `/.claude/aichaku/standards.json`
- `/.claude/aichaku/.aichaku-project`
- `/.claude/aichaku/.aichaku.json`
- `/.claude/aichaku/.aichaku-behavior`
- `/.claude/aichaku/RULES-REMINDER.md`

## Problems Solved

1. **Duplication in ~/.claude/aichaku/**: Identified and removed legacy flat structure vs nested structure confusion

2. **Missing YAML Files at Runtime**: Recognized that YAML files weren't being distributed during upgrade (unreleased
   feature)

3. **Path Mismatches**: Fixed incorrect paths in YAML files that pointed to source locations instead of runtime
   locations

4. **Configuration Sprawl**: Consolidated 6+ config files into single `aichaku.json`

5. **Inconsistent Naming**: Standardized all methodology guide filenames for better maintainability

## Lessons Learned

1. **Evolution Leaves Artifacts**: Multiple iterations of the project structure left behind redundant files and folders
   that needed cleanup

2. **Source vs Runtime Paths**: Important distinction between where files live in the repo vs where they're installed on
   user systems

3. **Configuration as Code**: Moving toward YAML-based configurations supports the goal of reducing CLAUDE.md token
   pressure

4. **Consistency Matters**: Simple, consistent naming (like `kanban/kanban.md`) is more maintainable than verbose names

5. **Machine-Readable Formats**: YAML is more efficient for Claude to parse than Markdown for configuration/rules

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Configuration as Code**: Create reference-based CLAUDE.md that pulls from YAML files to reduce token
   pressure

2. **Fix Broken Commands**:
   - Fix `--remove` command for standards (currently gives no feedback)
   - Implement new `--show` command for displaying standard details

3. **Update Upgrade Process**: Ensure YAML files are distributed during `aichaku upgrade`

4. **Clean Legacy Structure in Runtime**: Add migration logic to clean up old flat structure in existing installations

5. **Test Distribution**: Verify all changes work correctly when distributed via JSR/npm
