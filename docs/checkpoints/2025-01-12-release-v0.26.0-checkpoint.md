## Summary

Successfully released Aichaku v0.26.0 with HTTP/SSE server mode for MCP, fixing all critical issues discovered during
testing.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Fixed All Lint/Format Errors (24 total)

- Changed `any` to `unknown` types throughout codebase
- Fixed unused variables with underscore prefix
- Converted to type imports for proper module syntax
- Fixed async/await patterns in constructors
- Resolved all TypeScript compilation errors

### 2. Successfully Released v0.26.0

- Created GitHub release with all assets
- Published to JSR registry
- Uploaded compiled binaries for all platforms
- Fixed draft release status

### 3. Fixed Upgrade Command

- Implemented multi-location metadata search
- Added support for legacy config file locations
- Created cleanup command for removing old files
- Fixed version display showing outdated versions

### 4. MCP HTTP/SSE Server Working

- Fixed path resolution for installed versions
- Implemented fallback to GitHub download
- Confirmed session tracking functionality
- Tested with both code and documentation reviews

### 5. Documentation Updates

- Added cleanup command documentation
- Expanded HTTP/SSE server documentation
- Updated README with new features

## Key Files Modified

- `/src/utils/mcp-http-client.ts` - Fixed async promise executor
- `/src/commands/upgrade-fix.ts` - Added metadata location handling
- `/src/commands/cleanup.ts` - New cleanup command
- `/src/commands/mcp.ts` - Fixed HTTP server startup
- `/scripts/package-and-upload.ts` - Dynamic version import
- `/README.md` - Added cleanup and HTTP/SSE docs

## Testing Results

### MCP HTTP/SSE Server

```text
✅ Server starts successfully
✅ Session tracking increments properly
✅ Code review works (test.js)
✅ Documentation review works (README.md, test-doc.md)
```

### Installation/Upgrade

```text
✅ Global installation from JSR works
✅ Upgrade command finds correct metadata
✅ Cleanup removes legacy files
✅ Version displays correctly (0.26.0)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Metadata Migration**: Multiple config file locations require careful handling during upgrades
2. **Path Resolution**: Installed packages need different path resolution than development
3. **Binary Versioning**: Package script must use dynamic VERSION import
4. **Global vs Local**: Clear separation needed between dev and installed environments

## Next Steps (Future Work)

While all requested tasks are complete, potential future enhancements could include:

- Enhanced telemetry for MCP server usage
- More sophisticated session management
- Additional review rule sets
- Performance optimizations for large projects

## Release Notes Summary

### v0.26.0 Changes

- **Fixed**: MCP HTTP server startup for installed version
- **Fixed**: Upgrade command metadata handling
- **Added**: Cleanup command for legacy files
- **Changed**: Applied code formatting throughout

## Final State
