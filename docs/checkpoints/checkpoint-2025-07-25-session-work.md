# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-25 - Session Work

## Summary of Work Accomplished

- Fixed pre-commit hooks to only process staged files instead of entire codebase
- Updated checkpoint slash command to be deterministic with proper filename handling
- Applied same hook improvements to dotfiles repo for consistency across all projects
- Removed "Next Review" field from existing checkpoint to maintain historical snapshot format
- Enhanced Markdown linting hook to prevent post-commit unstaged changes

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Staged-file-only processing**: Modified both formatting and linting hooks to only process files that were originally
  staged for commit, preventing unintended file staging
- **Deterministic checkpoint template**: Added explicit constraints and fallback naming to prevent random additions and
  ensure consistent output format

## Files Created/Modified

### Created

- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-25-session-work.md` - This checkpoint documenting hook improvements

### Modified

- `.githooks/hooks.d/10-format-code` - Updated to only format staged files with proper file filtering
- `.githooks/hooks.d/20-lint-markdown` - Enhanced to only auto-fix staged Markdown files
- `.githooks/lib/common.sh` - Updated stage_changes function to accept specific file lists
- `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-2025-07-24-comprehensive-analysis.md` - Removed inappropriate "Next Review" field
- `/Users/rcogley/.dotfiles/adhoc/git/hooks/lib/common.sh` - Applied same stage_changes improvements
- `/Users/rcogley/.dotfiles/adhoc/git/hooks/10-format-code` - Complete rewrite with staged-file-only processing
- `/Users/rcogley/.dotfiles/adhoc/git/hooks/20-lint-markdown` - Added staged-file filtering and targeted auto-fixes
- `/Users/rcogley/.claude/commands/aichaku/checkpoint.md` - Added deterministic constraints and filename fallback

## Problems Solved

- **Post-commit unstaged changes**: Eliminated issue where pre-commit hooks would format entire codebase and leave
  unrelated files unstaged after commits
- **Malformed checkpoint filenames**: Fixed issue where empty arguments would create files like
  "checkpoint-2025-07-25-.md" by adding fallback naming
- **Non-deterministic checkpoint content**: Prevented random additions like review dates and analyst metadata through
  explicit template constraints

## Lessons Learned

- Git hooks must be carefully scoped to avoid unintended consequences on workflow
- Template systems require explicit constraints to ensure deterministic behavior
- Consistency across dotfiles and project-specific configurations is crucial for reliable automation

## Next Steps

- Monitor hook behavior across different commit scenarios to ensure reliability
- Verify that future checkpoint creation follows the new deterministic template format
- Consider applying similar scoping principles to other automated development tools
