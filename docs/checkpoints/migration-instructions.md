# Migration Instructions for docs/ Structure

## Summary

We've successfully migrated from `.claude/` to `/docs/` structure for better @ autocomplete support and GitHub Pages
visibility.

## New Structure

```text
docs/
├── projects/
│   ├── active/      # Active project documentation
│   ├── done/        # Completed project documentation
│   └── index.md     # GitHub Pages index
├── checkpoints/     # Session checkpoints
│   └── index.md     # GitHub Pages index
└── ...              # Other existing docs
```

## Updated `/checkpoint` Command for ~/.claude/settings.json

Replace the existing checkpoint command (lines 39-41) with:

```json
{
  "name": "checkpoint",
  "description": "Save session summary to docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}.md",
  "prompt": "Create a session checkpoint by following these steps in order:\n\n1. CREATE CHECKPOINT FILE:\n   - Path: `docs/checkpoints/checkpoint-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}.md` (use today's date and a descriptive name based on the work done)\n   - Create directory if needed: `mkdir -p docs/checkpoints`\n   - Use markdown format\n\n2. CHECKPOINT CONTENT (use these exact sections):\n   # Session Checkpoint - YYYY-MM-DD - {Descriptive Name}\n   \n   ## Summary of Work Accomplished\n   List main tasks completed with brief descriptions\n   \n   ## Key Technical Decisions\n   Document important architectural/implementation choices and rationale\n   \n   ## Files Created/Modified\n   ### Created\n   - List new files with purpose\n   ### Modified\n   - List changed files with type of change\n   \n   ## Problems Solved\n   List issues resolved and their solutions\n   \n   ## Lessons Learned\n   Key insights or patterns discovered\n   \n   ## Next Steps\n   Potential future work or improvements\n\nIf a checkpoint for today already exists with the same descriptive name, append to it with a timestamp separator. Show progress after each step. If any step fails, report the error and continue with remaining steps."
}
```

## Testing the New Structure

1. **Test @ autocomplete**:
   - Try `@docs/projects/active/` to see active projects
   - Try `@docs/checkpoints/` to see session checkpoints

2. **Test /checkpoint command**:
   - Use `/checkpoint` to save a session summary
   - Verify it creates file in `docs/checkpoints/`

3. **GitHub Pages**:
   - Visit your GitHub Pages site
   - Navigate to `/docs/projects/` and `/docs/checkpoints/`
   - Index files provide navigation

## Benefits

1. **Better Discovery**: @ autocomplete now works for all project and session files
2. **Public Documentation**: Project documentation can be browsed via GitHub Pages
3. **Consistent Structure**: All documentation in one place
4. **No Special Magic**: `.claude/` had no special behavior, so no functionality lost

## Notes

- The `.claude/` directory still contains methodologies, user customizations, etc.
- Only output and session files were moved to `/docs/`
- CLAUDE.md has been updated with new paths
- Migration script preserved for reference
