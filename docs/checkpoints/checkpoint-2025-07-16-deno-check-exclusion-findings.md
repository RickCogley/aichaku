# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-16 - Deno Check Exclusion Findings

## Summary

Investigated how `deno check` handles exclusions in deno.json configuration. Discovered that unlike `deno fmt` and
`deno lint`, the `deno check` command does NOT support exclusions through deno.json.

## Key Findings

### What Works

- **deno fmt**: Respects the `"fmt": { "exclude": [...] }` section in deno.json
- **deno lint**: Respects the `"lint": { "exclude": [...] }` section in deno.json
- Both tools properly skip files matching the exclusion patterns

### What Doesn't Work

- **deno check**: Has no exclusion support in deno.json
- Adding a `"check": { "exclude": [...] }` section is invalid and ignored
- The only way to exclude files from `deno check` is by:
  1. Specifying explicit file lists in the command
  2. Not running it at all on problematic files

## Test Results

Created test file with intentional type error:

```typescript
// test-exclusion.ts
const x: string = 123; // Type error
```

Results:

- `deno fmt test-exclusion.ts`: Skipped when file is in fmt.exclude
- `deno lint test-exclusion.ts`: Skipped when file is in lint.exclude
- `deno check test-exclusion.ts`: Always runs, no exclusion mechanism

## Implications for Nagare Release Process

Since nagare runs `deno check` on all TypeScript files and there's no way to configure exclusions:

1. **Current Working Solution**: Keep "type-check" disabled in nagare's autofix configuration
2. **Alternative**: Maintain explicit file lists in pre-release hooks (current approach)
3. **Not Viable**: Using deno.json to exclude files from type checking

## Updated Approach

Given these findings, the best approach is to:

1. Keep the current solution (disabled type-check in nagare autofix)
2. Use deno.json exclusions for fmt and lint (already implemented)
3. Rely on pre-release hooks with explicit file lists for type checking
4. Document this limitation for future reference

## Files Modified

- Removed invalid `"check"` section from deno.json
- Kept valid `"fmt"` and `"lint"` exclusion sections
- Nagare config continues with type-check disabled in autofix

## Lessons Learned

- Not all Deno tools support the same configuration options
- Always verify tool behavior before implementing configuration changes
- The Deno documentation doesn't explicitly state that check lacks exclusion support
- Testing assumptions is critical before implementing solutions
