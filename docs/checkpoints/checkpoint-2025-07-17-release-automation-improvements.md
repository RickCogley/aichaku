# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-17 - Release Automation Improvements

## Summary of Work Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Nagare Release Process Issues

- Resolved type checking failures by implementing top-level exclude in deno.json
- Fixed JSR publishing error by removing version.ts from exclusions
- Successfully published v0.30.0 after multiple iterations

### 2. Documented Deno Check Exclusion Behavior

- Discovered that `deno check` (no args) respects top-level exclude as of Deno v2.3.1+
- Created comprehensive documentation of findings and migration guide
- Updated project configuration to use proper exclusion patterns

### 3. Created Release Automation Enhancement Project

- Designed Shape Up pitch for 4-day release process overhaul
- Documented lessons learned from v0.30.0 release failures
- Proposed atomic, single-command release solution

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Top-Level Exclude Configuration

**Decision**: Use top-level `exclude` in deno.json instead of tool-specific exclusions **Rationale**: Only way to make
`deno check` respect exclusions when run without arguments

### 2. Pre-Release Hook Standardization

**Decision**: Update nagare.config.ts to use `deno check` without arguments **Rationale**: Ensures consistency between
local checks and CI/CD pipeline

### 3. Atomic Release Architecture

**Decision**: Design state machine-based release orchestrator **Rationale**: Prevents partial releases (npm succeeds,
JSR fails) and enables recovery

  post-mortem

### Modified

- `deno.json` - Added top-level exclude, removed version.ts from excludes
- `nagare.config.ts` - Updated pre-release hook to use `deno check` without args
- `docs/projects/active/active-2025-07-16-deno-json-surgical-exclusion/*.md` - Formatted for consistency

## Problems Solved

### 1. Type Checking Inconsistency

**Problem**: Nagare checked all files while pre-release hooks checked specific files **Solution**: Standardized on
`deno check` with top-level exclude configuration

### 2. JSR Publishing Failure

**Problem**: version.ts was excluded but needed in module graph **Solution**: Removed version.ts from all exclude lists

### 3. Manual Release Process

**Problem**: 8+ manual steps prone to errors and omissions **Solution**: Designed automated release orchestrator with
single command

### 4. Tag Management Complexity

**Problem**: Manual tag updates and force-pushing after fixes **Solution**: Proposed automatic tag management in release
tool

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Deno Tool Behavior Varies by Arguments

- `deno check` respects top-level exclude
- `deno check .` and `deno check **/*.ts` ignore exclusions
- Critical to understand tool behavior for CI/CD consistency

### 2. Partial Release Success is Dangerous

- Publishing to one registry but not another creates inconsistent state
- Atomic operations are essential for multi-registry publishing

### 3. Pre-flight Validation Must Match CI

- Every check that CI performs must run locally first
- Includes formatting of documentation files, not just code

### 4. Import Chains Affect Type Checking

- Excluding a file doesn't prevent checking if it's imported
- Must exclude all files in the import chain

### 5. Release Automation ROI is High

- Current process: ~30 minutes with multiple manual steps
- Proposed process: <5 minutes fully automated
- Prevents errors, reduces stress, improves velocity

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. Implement release automation enhancement (4-day project)
2. Test automated release with v0.31.0
3. Document new release process

### Future Improvements

1. Add changelog generation to release process
2. Implement semantic version detection from commits
3. Create release preview/simulation mode
4. Add telemetry for release process monitoring
5. Consider moving deprecated v2 files to separate package

### Process Improvements

1. Run `deno fmt` on all files before committing
2. Always validate that excluded files aren't in module graph
3. Test release process in dry-run mode first
4. Document all manual steps for automation candidates
