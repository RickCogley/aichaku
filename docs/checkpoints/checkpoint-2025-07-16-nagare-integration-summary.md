# Session Checkpoint - 2025-07-16 - Nagare Integration Summary

## Problem Summary

The nagare release process was failing due to type checking errors in excluded
files (v2 files and config-manager.ts). The issue was complex because:

1. Pre-release hooks and nagare's autofix were checking different sets of files

2. `deno check` behavior with exclusions was not well understood

3. Nagare's built-in type checking may not be using the optimal command

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Top-Level Exclude in deno.json

Added a top-level `"exclude"` array that is respected by:

- `deno fmt` (via the fmt section)

- `deno lint` (via the lint section)

- `deno check` (when run WITHOUT arguments)

````json
{
  "exclude": [
    ".claude/",
    "scratch/",
    "version.ts",
    "docs/api/",
    "docs/projects/**/*.ts",
    "examples/**/*.ts",
    "src/commands/*-v2.ts",
    "src/utils/config-manager.ts",
    "src/utils/migration-helper.ts"
  ]
}
```text

### 2. Updated Pre-Release Hook

Changed the pre-release hook to run `deno check` without arguments:

```typescript
const checkCmd = new Deno.Command("deno", {
  args: ["check"], // No args = respects top-level exclude
});
```text

### 3. Re-enabled Nagare Type Checking

Re-enabled type checking in nagare's autofix configuration:

```typescript
types: [
  "lint",
  "format",
  "security-scan",
  "type-check", // Re-enabled: deno check now respects top-level exclude
  "version-conflict",
],
```text

## Key Learnings

1. **Deno Check Behavior**: As of Deno v2.3.1+:

   - `deno check` → Respects top-level exclude ✅

   - `deno check .` → Ignores exclusions ❌

   - `deno check **/*.ts` → Ignores exclusions ❌

2. **Configuration Hierarchy**: Top-level exclude works for all tools, but each
   tool section can have its own exclude as well

3. **YAML Files**: Correctly kept in linting/formatting since they're source
   configuration files, not generated docs

## Current Status

✅ All exclusions properly configured ✅ Pre-release hooks updated to use
correct command ✅ Nagare type checking re-enabled ✅ Release process should now
work with all safety checks

## Remaining Question

We're not 100% certain how nagare's autofix runs the type-check command
internally. If it runs `deno check` with arguments (like `deno check .`), it
would still fail. This needs to be verified in nagare's source code or through
testing an actual release.

## Next Steps

1. Run a test release to verify everything works

2. If nagare's autofix still fails, may need to:

   - Submit PR to nagare to use `deno check` without arguments

   - Or keep type-check disabled in nagare autofix and rely on pre-release hooks
