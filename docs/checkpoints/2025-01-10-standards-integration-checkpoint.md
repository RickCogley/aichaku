# Checkpoint Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. âœ… Hooks Command Implementation

- Created `aichaku hooks` command for Claude Code hook management

- Implemented hook templates for path validation, status updates, and
  methodology detection

- Fixed multiple issues (missing utils, color references, JSON parsing with
  comments)

- Successfully tested with `--list` and `--install basic` options

### 2. âœ… Standards Command Implementation

- Created `aichaku standards` command for modular guidance selection

- Implemented user choice interface with categories (security, architecture,
  development, testing, devops)

- Added support for adding/removing/showing standards

- Fixed comma-separated parsing and boolean/string option conflicts

- Incorporated user feedback: emphasized user choice, better UX with "what you
  CAN do", consistent ðŸª´ branding

### 3. âœ… Enhanced Integrate Command

- Updated `integrate` command to support both methodology and standards sections

- Implemented dual marker system (METHODOLOGY and STANDARDS markers)

- Created standard content files (owasp-web.md, 15-factor.md, tdd.md,
  nist-csf.md)

- Successfully tested integration with multiple standards

- Standards section dynamically generated based on user selections

## Key User Insights

- User's name is Rick

- Emphasized "world-famous aichaku branding" (ðŸª´)

- Focus on user choice over auto-detection

- Clear next steps showing what users CAN do, not just what they need to do

- Integration purpose: standards in CLAUDE.md for proactive code generation +
  MCP for reactive review

## Current State

- All major features for standards integration are implemented and tested

- The system now supports modular guidance with user choice

- Enhanced integrate command successfully creates/updates CLAUDE.md with both
  methodology and selected standards

- Clear workflow: select standards â†’ integrate â†’ code generation with standards
  awareness

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Implement role-based prompting system** (pending)

2. **Resolve SECURITY_WORKFLOWS.md placement** (pending)

3. **Create MCP code reviewer** (concept completed, implementation pending)

## Files Modified

- `/src/commands/hooks.ts` - New hooks command

- `/src/commands/standards.ts` - New standards command

- `/src/commands/integrate.ts` - Enhanced with standards support

- `/cli.ts` - Added hooks and standards commands

- Created standard content files in `~/.claude/docs/standards/`

The implementation successfully addresses Rick's vision for modular, user-choice
driven standards selection with seamless integration into Claude Code's
workflow.
