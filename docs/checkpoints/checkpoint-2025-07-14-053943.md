# Checkpoint Summary - 2025-07-14

## Session Overview

Analyzed and categorized 118 permissions from the Aichaku project's `.claude/settings.local.json` file to help identify
which permissions should be included in a global Claude Code configuration versus remaining project-specific.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Permission categorization**: Organized permissions into 11 logical groups based on tool type and purpose
- **Global vs local strategy**: Recommended including generic development tools, version control, and utilities in
  global config while keeping project-specific paths and scripts local
- **Security consideration**: All permissions were in the "allow" list with no entries in the "deny" list

## Files Modified

- **`.claude/settings.local.json`** - Read and analyzed (not modified) to extract and categorize permission entries

## Problems Solved

- **Unorganized permission list**: Successfully sorted 118 permissions into clear categories:
  - Core Development Tools (13 Deno commands)
  - Git Operations (12 items including 6 project-specific)
  - GitHub CLI (12 commands)
  - Basic Unix Commands (16 utilities)
  - Shell/Script Execution (8 items)
  - Network Tools (6 items - curl + 5 domains)
  - Claude CLI (5 commands)
  - MCP Tools (12 items across different servers)
  - Project-Specific Aichaku (17 items)
  - Project-Specific Scripts (11 test/utility scripts)
  - Other Tools (3 items - pandoc, nagare, npm)

## Next Steps

1. Create a global Claude Code configuration with essential permissions:
   - All Deno commands (`deno check`, `deno fmt`, `deno lint`, etc.)
   - Generic Git commands (exclude project-specific paths)
   - All GitHub CLI commands (`gh run`, `gh workflow`, `gh release`, etc.)
   - Common Unix utilities (`ls`, `grep`, `find`, `mkdir`, etc.)
   - Claude CLI and all MCP tools
   - Essential network tools and documentation domains

2. Keep local to this project:
   - Project-specific Git commands with full paths
   - Test scripts and project-specific executables
   - Version-specific binary paths
   - Local script files

3. Consider adding to global config based on usage patterns:
   - Generic `aichaku` commands if used across projects
   - Common interpreters (`bash`, `python3`)
   - Documentation tools (`pandoc`) if frequently used
