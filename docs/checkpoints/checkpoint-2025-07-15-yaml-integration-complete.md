# Checkpoint: YAML Integration System Complete

Date: 2025-07-15
Status: ✅ Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the YAML-based configuration-as-code system for Aichaku, reducing CLAUDE.md file size from 50KB+ to ~2KB while maintaining all functionality.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Core YAML Configuration Files Created

Created under `/docs/core/`:
- `behavioral-directives.yaml` - Core integration rules and discussion-first approach
- `visual-identity.yaml` - Aichaku branding and progress indicators
- `file-organization.yaml` - Project structure and naming conventions
- `diagram-templates.yaml` - Mermaid diagram requirements
- `metadata.yaml` - Defines which core files to include

### 2. Methodology YAML Files Completed

Created YAML configurations for all methodologies:
- ✅ `shape-up/shape-up.yaml` (already existed)
- ✅ `scrum/scrum.yaml` (already existed)
- ✅ `kanban/kanban.yaml` (created)
- ✅ `lean/lean.yaml` (created)
- ✅ `xp/xp.yaml` (created)
- ✅ `scrumban/scrumban.yaml` (created)

### 3. Configuration Reader Implementation

Created `/src/utils/yaml-config-reader.ts`:
- Reads YAML files from multiple sources
- Merges configurations in correct order (core first)
- Supports methodology quick reference
- Handles missing files gracefully

### 4. Integration Command Refactored

Updated `/src/commands/integrate.ts`:
- Replaced hardcoded `METHODOLOGY_SECTION` with YAML assembly
- Uses `assembleYamlConfig()` to build configuration
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Properly orders content (core first, then methodologies)

### 5. Cleanup Completed

Removed incorrect implementations:
- Deleted `yaml-generator.ts` (violated CoC principles)
- Deleted `integrate-yaml.ts` (separate command)
- Removed MCP directory files
- Fixed duplicate YAML blocks in CLAUDE.md

## Technical Details

### Configuration as Code (CoC) Principles

The implementation follows true configuration-as-code:
- YAML files are the single source of truth
- No hardcoded content generation in TypeScript
- Human-editable configuration files
- Code dynamically reads values when needed

### File Structure

```text
/docs/
├── core/
│   ├── behavioral-directives.yaml
│   ├── visual-identity.yaml
│   ├── file-organization.yaml
│   ├── diagram-templates.yaml
│   └── metadata.yaml
├── methodologies/
│   ├── shape-up/shape-up.yaml
│   ├── scrum/scrum.yaml
│   ├── kanban/kanban.yaml
│   ├── lean/lean.yaml
│   ├── xp/xp.yaml
│   └── scrumban/scrumban.yaml
└── standards/
    └── (various standards YAML files)
```

### YAML Block Assembly Order

1. Core configuration (behavioral, visual, etc.)
2. Methodology quick reference
3. Selected methodologies details
4. Selected standards
5. User customizations (if present)

## Results

- **CLAUDE.md size**: Reduced from 50KB+ to ~2KB
- **Functionality**: All features preserved
- **Maintainability**: Configuration now in human-editable YAML
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new methodologies or standards

## Next Steps

1. Install configuration files to `~/.claude/aichaku/` for production use
2. Update documentation to explain YAML system
3. Consider adding validation for YAML schema
4. Add support for project-specific YAML overrides

## Testing

Ran `aichaku integrate` command successfully:
- All methodologies loaded without errors
- YAML configuration properly assembled
- Core configuration appears first in output
- No duplicate blocks in CLAUDE.md

## Lessons Learned

1. Configuration as Code means source files, not generated content
2. YAML merge order matters for proper display
3. Removing legacy code requires careful file tracking
4. Testing with actual command execution catches integration issues

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the Aichaku methodology system while drastically reducing file sizes and improving maintainability.
