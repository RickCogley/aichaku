# Execution Mode

## üèóÔ∏è PROJECT STRUCTURE - ALWAYS START HERE

When you hear any of these:

- "Let's build..." / "Implement..." / "Code..."

- "Create..." / "Develop..." / "Make..."

- "Fix this bug..." / "Add feature..."

- "Start working on..." / "Let's do this..."

IMMEDIATELY create (if not exists): üìÅ
`docs/projects/active/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{descriptive-name}/` ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ STATUS.md

This is automatic - users shouldn't need to ask!

**ACTIVATES WHEN**: User ready to build, implement, code, or complete work

**TRIGGERS**: "build", "implement", "let's do this", "start coding", "execute"

## Quick Start

````text
LOAD plan ‚Üí APPLY constraints ‚Üí EXECUTE work ‚Üí REPORT progress
```text

## Universal Execution Flow

1. **LOAD CONTEXT**

   ```text
   What: [From plan or user]
   How: [Methodology constraints]
   Who: [Solo or team]
````

2. **EXECUTE WITH CONSTRAINTS**

   ```text
   Shape Up ‚Üí Respect appetite, no scope creep
   Scrum ‚Üí Stay within sprint, update board
   Kanban ‚Üí Respect WIP limits, pull only
   XP ‚Üí Test first, pair if specified
   ```

3. **REPORT PROGRESS**
   ```text
   ‚úÖ Completed: [what's done]
   üöß In Progress: [what's active]
   üö´ Blocked: [what's stuck + why]
   ```

## Methodology Constraints

### Shape Up Execution

````text
RULES:

- Stop at appetite limit (no extensions)

- No new scope after betting

- Build exactly what was shaped

- Ship or stop, no in-between

PROGRESS:
"Day 3 of 10: Auth flow complete, starting preferences"
```text

### Scrum Execution

```text
RULES:

- Complete sprint commitment

- Update board daily

- No additions mid-sprint

- Definition of Done mandatory

PROGRESS:
Daily standup format:

- Did: [yesterday]

- Doing: [today]

- Blocked: [impediments]
```text

### Kanban Execution

```text
RULES:

- Pull only when capacity

- Respect WIP limits absolutely

- Update board immediately

- Finish before starting

PROGRESS:
"Moved #123 to Review, pulling #456 from Ready"
```text

### XP Execution

```text
RULES:

- Write test first

- Make it pass

- Refactor

- Integrate frequently

PATTERN:
üî¥ RED ‚Üí üü¢ GREEN ‚Üí üîµ REFACTOR ‚Üí ‚úÖ COMMIT
```text

## Context Adaptations

### Solo Execution

```text

- Direct implementation

- Self-review patterns

- Simplified reporting

- Fast decision making
```text

### Team Execution

```text

- Coordinate handoffs

- Update shared board

- Communicate blockers

- Sync at boundaries
```text

### Urgent Execution

```text

- Minimal process

- Focus on delivery

- Document after

- Communicate status
```text

## Common Patterns

### Starting Work

```text
‚úÖ Ready to start [task name]
Approach: [brief strategy]
Estimated: [time/complexity]
First step: [specific action]
```text

### Hitting a Blocker

```text
üö´ BLOCKED on [task]
Issue: [specific problem]
Need: [what would unblock]
Meanwhile: [alternative work]
```text

### Completing Work

```text
‚úÖ COMPLETE: [task name]
What: [brief summary]
Testing: [how verified]
Next: [logical next task]
```text

## Quick Actions

### "Just build it"

```text
Detected: Simple task, solo context
Skipping: Formal planning
Approach: Direct implementation
Constraint: [Methodology-specific limit]
Starting: Now
```text

### "Implement the plan"

```text
Loading: [plan document]
Tasks: [1, 2, 3...]
Order: Sequential/Parallel
Constraints: [from methodology]
First task: Starting now
```text

### "Fix this bug"

```text
Mode: Kanban flow
Priority: [Urgent/High/Normal]
WIP check: [Current capacity]
Action: [Pull/Queue/Defer]
```text

## Progress Tracking

### Minimal (Solo)

```text
‚ñ° ‚ñ° ‚ñ° ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† ‚ñ† (37% complete)
```text

### Detailed (Team)

```text
Sprint Progress: Day 3 of 10

- Completed: 5 points

- In Progress: 8 points

- Remaining: 21 points

- Velocity: On track
```text

### Continuous (Kanban)

```text
This week: 12 items completed
Average cycle time: 2.3 days
Current WIP: 5 of 6 (near limit)
```text

## Quality Checks

Before marking complete:

```text
‚ñ° Meets requirements
‚ñ° Tests pass (if applicable)
‚ñ° Code reviewed (if team)
‚ñ° Documentation updated
‚ñ° Ready for next stage
```text

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå Starting without clear requirements ‚ùå Ignoring methodology constraints\
‚ùå Silent struggles with blockers ‚ùå Scope creep during execution ‚ùå Skipping
quality checks

## Remember

Execution Mode is about getting things done within constraints. Focus on
progress, communicate blockers, maintain quality.
