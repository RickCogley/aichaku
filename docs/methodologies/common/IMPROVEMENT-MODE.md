# Improvement Mode

## üèóÔ∏è PROJECT STRUCTURE - ALWAYS START HERE

When you hear any of these:

- "How are we doing?" / "Let's review..."

- "Retrospective..." / "What's working?"

- "Improve..." / "Optimize..." / "Refactor..."

- "Measure..." / "Metrics..." / "Performance..."

CONTINUE in existing folder OR create new: üìÅ
`docs/projects/active/{YYYY-MM-DD}-{descriptive-name}/` ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ STATUS.md (update to
IMPROVEMENT mode)

This is automatic - users shouldn't need to ask!

**ACTIVATES WHEN**: User wants to review, reflect, measure, or improve process

**TRIGGERS**: "how are we doing", "retrospective", "metrics", "what's working",
"review"

## Quick Start

````text
MEASURE performance ‚Üí IDENTIFY patterns ‚Üí SUGGEST improvements
```text

## Universal Improvement Flow

1. **COLLECT DATA**

   ```text
   What: Metrics for active methodology
   Period: Last sprint/week/cycle
   Context: Team size, work type
````

2. **ANALYZE PATTERNS**

   ```text
   ‚úÖ What's working well
   ‚ö†Ô∏è What needs attention
   üìà Trends over time
   ```

3. **SUGGEST ACTIONS**
   ```text
   Quick wins: [immediate improvements]
   Experiments: [things to try]
   Stop doing: [waste to eliminate]
   ```

## Methodology Metrics

### Shape Up

````text
MEASURE:

- Cycles completed on time

- Appetite accuracy

- Bets won vs lost

- Cooldown effectiveness

HEALTHY:
‚úÖ 80%+ on-time delivery
‚úÖ Rare appetite extensions
‚úÖ Clear no-gos preventing scope creep
```text

### Scrum

```text
MEASURE:

- Velocity trend

- Sprint commitment accuracy

- Burndown patterns

- Escaped defects

HEALTHY:
‚úÖ Stable velocity ¬±10%
‚úÖ 85%+ commitment met
‚úÖ Consistent burndown
```text

### Kanban

```text
MEASURE:

- Cycle time trend

- Throughput stability

- WIP limit violations

- Blocker frequency

HEALTHY:
‚úÖ Decreasing cycle time
‚úÖ Predictable throughput
‚úÖ Rare WIP violations
```text

### Lean

```text
MEASURE:

- Time to validate

- Pivot frequency

- Learning velocity

- Waste eliminated

HEALTHY:
‚úÖ Fast experiment cycles
‚úÖ Clear learning outcomes
‚úÖ Decreasing waste
```text

## Quick Assessments

### "How are we doing?"

```text
Last [period] summary:
‚úÖ Delivered: [X items/points]
üìä Velocity: [trend arrow]
‚è±Ô∏è Cycle time: [X days average]
üö´ Blockers: [X resolved]

Overall health: [Good/Caution/Needs attention]
Top insight: [Most important pattern]
```text

### "What should we improve?"

```text
Based on data, prioritize:

1. üéØ [Biggest impact item]
   Why: [Data supporting this]
   Try: [Specific action]

2. üîß [Quick fix]
   Why: [Easy win]
   Try: [Simple change]
```text

## Retrospective Formats

### Solo Reflection (5 min)

```text
This [period] I:
‚úÖ Succeeded at: [wins]
ü§î Struggled with: [challenges]
üí° Will try: [improvement]
```text

### Team Retro (30 min)

```text

1. Data review (5 min)

2. What went well? (10 min)

3. What was difficult? (10 min)

4. Actions for next cycle (5 min)

Output: 1-3 specific actions
```text

### Continuous Improvement

```text
Weekly metrics check:
‚ñ° Review dashboard
‚ñ° Note trends
‚ñ° Adjust one thing
‚ñ° Document result
```text

## Pattern Recognition

### Velocity Issues

```text
SYMPTOM: Declining delivery
CHECK:

- Complexity increasing?

- Team capacity changed?

- Technical debt growing?

- Process overhead?
```text

### Quality Issues

```text
SYMPTOM: More defects/rework
CHECK:

- Rushing to meet deadlines?

- Skipping quality steps?

- Unclear requirements?

- Missing tests?
```text

### Flow Issues

```text
SYMPTOM: Work getting stuck
CHECK:

- Bottleneck location?

- Dependencies external?

- WIP limits right?

- Skills gap?
```text

## Improvement Experiments

### Small (Try immediately)

```text
"Let's try [change] for one [cycle]"

- Adjust WIP limit by 1

- Add 5-min daily check

- Use new template
```text

### Medium (One cycle)

```text
"This [cycle] we'll experiment with..."

- New estimation method

- Different pairing rotation

- Adjusted ceremonies
```text

### Large (Multiple cycles)

```text
"Consider switching to..."

- Different methodology

- New team structure

- Major process change
```text

## Health Indicators

### üü¢ Healthy

- Consistent delivery

- Happy team

- Few surprises

- Continuous learning

### üü° Caution

- Irregular patterns

- Some frustration

- Repeated issues

- Stagnant metrics

### üî¥ Needs Help

- Missing commitments

- Team conflict

- Many blockers

- Declining metrics

## Quick Wins Library

### For any methodology:

- Visualize work better

- Reduce meeting time

- Clarify definitions

- Celebrate successes

- Remove one step

### Methodology-specific:

- Shape Up: Tighter no-gos

- Scrum: Shorter standups

- Kanban: Lower WIP limits

- XP: More pairing

- Lean: Faster experiments

## Remember

Improvement Mode is about learning from data, not blame. Focus on system
improvements, not individual performance. Small, continuous improvements beat
big changes.
