summary:
  critical: |
    - A01: Broken Access Control - Validate authorization on EVERY request
    - A02: Cryptographic Failures - Use strong encryption, secure key management
    - A03: Injection - Parameterized queries, input validation, output encoding
    - A07: Authentication Failures - Strong auth, proper session management
    - A09: Logging Failures - Log security events WITHOUT sensitive data
  security_headers: "X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, HSTS, CSP"
  input_validation: "Never trust user input - validate, sanitize, escape"
  error_handling: "Generic error messages, log details server-side only"
