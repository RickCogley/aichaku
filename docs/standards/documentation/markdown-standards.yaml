description: Universal formatting standards for all markdown documentation in the Aichaku ecosystem
version: "1.0.0"
tags:
  - formatting
  - consistency
  - professional
  - universal
  - mandatory

summary:
  critical: |
    Mandatory formatting rules that ensure professional, consistent, and maintainable
    documentation across all Aichaku projects, methodologies, and standards.

    Key Requirements:
    - Code blocks must have language specifications (```bash, ```text, etc.)
    - Proper name capitalization (GitHub, TypeScript, Aichaku)
    - Emphasis uses underscores (_text_) to match Prettier formatting
    - Headings and lists surrounded by blank lines
    - Fenced code blocks preferred over indented
    - Files end with single newline

  automation: |
    Fully automated through pre-commit hooks, editor integration,
    and linting tools. Compliance is enforced automatically.

  universality: |
    Applies to ALL markdown content regardless of methodology.
    Not optional - mandatory for professional appearance.
