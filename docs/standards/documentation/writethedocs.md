3. **üîÑ Iterative** - Documentation is never "done"
4. **üéØ User-Focused** - Write for your reader's success
5. **üåà Inclusive** - Welcome all contributors and readers

## Tutorial Guidelines

### Purpose

Guide newcomers through their first successful experience with your project.

### Structure

````markdown
# Getting Started with {{Project Name}}

Welcome! This tutorial walks you through using {{Project}} for the first time.
By the end, you'll have {{specific achievement}} and understand the basics of
{{key concepts}}.

## Before You Begin

This tutorial takes about [time] to complete.

### What You'll Need

- [Requirement]: [Why it's needed]
- [Requirement]: [Version required and why]
- Basic familiarity with [prerequisite knowledge]

> üí° **New to [prerequisite]?** Check out [this gentle introduction](link)
> first.

### What We'll Build

[Screenshot or diagram of the final result]

In this tutorial, we'll create [description of the end result]. This will teach
you:

- How [Project] handles [concept 1]
- The basics of [concept 2]
- Why [concept 3] matters

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

First, let's make sure everything is installed correctly.

### Install [Project]

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# For macOS/Linux
curl -sSL https://install.example.com | sh

# For Windows
iwr -useb https://install.example.com | iex
```
````

<details>
<summary>üîß Troubleshooting installation issues</summary>

**Permission denied error?** Try running with elevated permissions:

```bash
sudo curl -sSL https://install.example.com | sh
```

**Behind a proxy?** Set your proxy environment variables first:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
```

</details>

### Verify Your Installation

Check that everything is working:

```bash
project --version
```

You should see something like:

```
Project version 1.2.3
```

‚úÖ **Checkpoint**: You now have [Project] installed and ready to use!

## Step 2: Create Your First [Thing]

Now for the fun part - let's create something!

### Understanding the Basics

Before we dive in, here's a quick overview:

- **[Term 1]**: [Plain English explanation]
- **[Term 2]**: [Another clear explanation]

Don't worry if this doesn't all make sense yet - it will become clearer as we
work through the example.

### Create the Project Structure

1. Create a new directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-first-project
   cd my-first-project
   ```

2. Initialize a new [Project] configuration:

   ```bash
   project init
   ```

   This creates a basic structure:

   ```
   my-first-project/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml     # Your project configuration
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/           # Your source files go here
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md      # Project documentation
   ```

3. Open `config.yaml` in your favorite editor and update it:

   ```yaml
   # Before
   name: my-project
   version: 0.1.0

   # After
   name: my-first-project
   version: 0.1.0
   description: Learning [Project] with the tutorial
   ```

### Write Your First [Component]

Create a new file `src/hello.ext`:

```language
// This is your first [component]
// It demonstrates [what it shows]

[actual code here]
```

Let's break down what this does:

- **Line 1-2**: Comments explaining the purpose
- **Line 4**: [Explanation of key line]
- **Line 5**: [Explanation of another important part]

### Run Your Code

Time to see it in action:

```bash
project run src/hello.ext
```

You should see:

```
[Expected output]
Success! Your first [component] is working.
```

üéâ **Congratulations!** You just created and ran your first [Project] program!

## How-to Guide Guidelines

### Purpose
Help users accomplish specific tasks efficiently, assuming basic familiarity with the project.

### Structure
```markdown
# How to [Specific Task]

This guide shows you how to [task description]. This is useful when you need to [use case/scenario].

**Time:** About [X] minutes
**Difficulty:** [Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced]

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] [Prerequisite 1] ([how to verify])
- [ ] [Prerequisite 2] ([link to setup guide])
- [ ] [Required permission or access]

## Overview

We'll accomplish this task by:
1. [High-level step 1]
2. [High-level step 2]
3. [High-level step 3]

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Environment

First, we need to set up [what and why]:

```bash
# Set necessary environment variables
export PROJECT_ENV=production
export API_KEY=your-api-key-here
````

> üìù **Note**: Store sensitive values like API keys in a `.env` file. See
> [Managing Secrets](link) for details.

### 2. [Main Action]

Now we'll [what you're doing and why]:

```bash
project command --option value \
  --another-option \
  --verbose
```

**What's happening here:**

- `--option value`: [Explanation]
- `--another-option`: [Why you need this]
- `--verbose`: Shows detailed output (helpful for debugging)

<details>
<summary>Alternative: Using the configuration file</summary>

Instead of command-line options, you can use a configuration file:

```yaml
# config.yaml
options:
  option: value
  another_option: true
  verbose: true
```

Then run:

```bash
project command --config config.yaml
```

</details>

### 3. Verify Success

Check that your [task] completed successfully:

```bash
project status --check [thing-you-created]
```

Expected output:

```
Status: Active
Health: Healthy
Last Updated: 2023-10-15 14:30:00
```

## Common Variations

### Using with Docker

If you're running [Project] in Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM project:latest
COPY config.yaml /app/
RUN project command --config /app/config.yaml
```

### Automating with CI/CD

For GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Run [task]
  env:
    PROJECT*ENV: ${{ secrets.PROJECT*ENV }}
  run: |
    project command --option ${{ inputs.value }}
```

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>‚ùå Error: "Permission denied"</summary>

This usually means you don't have the required access. Check:

1. You're authenticated: `project auth status`
2. You have the right role: `project iam check`
3. The resource exists: `project list resources`

</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ùå Error: "Resource not found"</summary>

Verify:

- The resource name is spelled correctly
- You're in the right project/namespace
- The resource hasn't been deleted

Run `project list resources --all` to see available resources.

</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Task succeeds but doesn't work as expected</summary>

Common causes:

1. **Caching**: Try clearing cache with `project cache clear`
2. **Timing**: Some changes take a few minutes to propagate
3. **Configuration**: Double-check your settings match the examples

</details>

# Understanding [Concept/System]

[Opening that connects to user needs and sets context]

## The Challenge

Before diving into how [concept] works, let's understand the problem it solves.

Imagine you're building [relatable scenario]. You need to:
- [Requirement 1 that seems simple]
- [Requirement 2 that adds complexity]
- [Requirement 3 that makes it challenging]

Traditional approaches like [alternative] fall short because [specific limitations]. This is where [concept] comes in.

## Core Concepts

### [Fundamental Concept 1]

[Plain language explanation using an analogy if helpful]

Think of it like [analogy]. When you [action in analogy], you [result]. Similarly, [concept] works by [parallel explanation].

**Key insight**: [The main thing to remember]

### [Fundamental Concept 2]

[Continue pattern...]

## How It Works

Let's trace through what happens when you [common user action]:
````

User Action ‚Üì [Component 1] ‚Üí "Validates and prepares request" ‚Üì [Component 2] ‚Üí
"Processes according to rules" ‚Üì [Component 3] ‚Üí "Returns formatted result" ‚Üì
User sees result

````
### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Initial Request**
   When you [action], the system first [what happens]. This is important because [why it matters].

2. **Processing Phase**
   Next, [component] takes your request and [detailed explanation]. During this phase:
   - [Sub-step 1]: [What and why]
   - [Sub-step 2]: [What and why]

3. **Result Generation**
   Finally, [explanation of how results are created and returned].

### A Real Example

Let's make this concrete with an actual example:

```python
# User code
result = system.process("Hello, World!")

# What happens internally:
# 1. Validation: Checks input is valid string
# 2. Transformation: Applies configured rules
# 3. Caching: Stores for future use
# 4. Return: Sends back processed result
````

## Design Decisions

### Why [Specific Choice]?

You might wonder why we [design decision] instead of [alternative]. Here's our
thinking:

**Option 1: [The alternative]**

- ‚úÖ Pro: [Advantage]
- ‚ùå Con: [Disadvantage that matters for our use case]

**Option 2: [Our choice]**

- ‚úÖ Pro: [Advantage that addresses the con above]
- ‚úÖ Pro: [Additional benefit]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-off: [Honest acknowledgment of any downsides]

We chose Option 2 because [reasoning tied to user needs].

### Performance Considerations

[Concept] is optimized for [specific use case]. This means:

- **Fast**: [Specific performance characteristic]
- **Efficient**: [Resource usage explanation]
- **Scalable**: [How it handles growth]

However, this optimization comes with trade-offs:

- [Trade-off 1]: [Impact and when it matters]
- [Trade-off 2]: [How to work around if needed]

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: [Descriptive Name]

**When to use**: [Specific scenario]

**How it works**:

```
[Visual representation or code example]
```

**Why it's effective**: [Benefits in this context]

### Pattern 2: [Another Pattern]

[Continue structure...]

## Comparison with Alternatives

Let's compare [concept] with similar approaches:

| Aspect          | [This Concept]    | [Alternative 1]   | [Alternative 2]   |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| **Use Case**    | [Best for]        | [Best for]        | [Best for]        |
| **Performance** | [Characteristics] | [Characteristics] | [Characteristics] |
| **Complexity**  | [Learning curve]  | [Learning curve]  | [Learning curve]  |
| **Flexibility** | [Customization]   | [Customization]   | [Customization]   |

### When to Choose [Concept]

Choose [concept] when:

- ‚úÖ Your priority is [specific need]
- ‚úÖ You need [specific capability]
- ‚úÖ Your team is comfortable with [specific requirement]

Consider alternatives when:

- ü§î You need [different priority]
- ü§î Your constraints include [specific limitation]
- ü§î You're already using [conflicting technology]

## Real-World Example

Let's look at how [Example Company] uses [concept] in production:

**Challenge**: They needed to [specific business need]

**Solution**: They implemented [concept] with these customizations:

- [Customization 1]: To handle [specific requirement]
- [Customization 2]: To integrate with [existing system]

**Results**:

- [Quantified improvement 1]
- [Quantified improvement 2]
- [Qualitative benefit]

**Lessons Learned**:

## Summary

Write the Docs principles emphasize:

1. **Documentation is everyone's job** - Not just technical writers
2. **Iterate based on feedback** - Docs are never "done"
3. **Lower barriers to contribution** - Make it easy to help
4. **Focus on user success** - Measure by user outcomes
5. **Build community** - Documentation connects people

Remember: The best documentation is the one that helps your users succeed at
their goals. Everything else is implementation details.
