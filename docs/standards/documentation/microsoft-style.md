# Microsoft Writing Style Guide

## Quick Reference

The Microsoft Writing Style Guide promotes clear, consistent, and accessible technical documentation with a warm,
approachable tone. It emphasizes inclusivity, global readability, and user empowerment.

### Core Principles

1. **üåç Global-ready** - Write for international audiences
2. **‚ôø Accessible** - Design for all abilities and contexts
3. **ü§ù Inclusive** - Welcome everyone with bias-free language
4. **üí° Clear** - Prioritize clarity over cleverness
5. **üöÄ Empowering** - Help users succeed and feel confident

## Tutorial Guidelines

### Purpose

Help users learn by doing, building confidence through successful completion of tasks.

### Structure

Microsoft tutorials follow a hands-on, step-by-step approach with clear outcomes and encouraging tone.

See the complete template: [`templates/tutorial-template.md`](./templates/tutorial-template.md)

Key structural elements:
- **Time estimate** upfront  
- **Prerequisites** section
- **Numbered steps** with clear actions
- **Encouragement** after each achievement  
- **What you learned** summary
- **Try this next** section for continued learning

### Microsoft Style Notes for Tutorials

- **Use "you" and active voice**: "You create a function" not "A function is created"
- **Be encouraging**: Use "Great!" or "Nice work!" to celebrate progress
- **Explain the why**: Help users understand the purpose, not just the steps
- **Use friendly contractions**: "you'll", "let's", "it's"
- **Include tips and notes**: Help users avoid common pitfalls

## How-to Guide Guidelines

### Purpose
Provide focused, task-oriented guidance for users who know what they want to accomplish.

### Structure
```markdown
# [Action verb] [specific task]

This article explains how to [task]. Use this approach when you want to [scenario].

**In this article**
- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Main task](#main-task)
- [Verify results](#verify-results)
- [Clean up resources](#clean-up-resources)

## Prerequisites

- [Specific requirement with version]
- [Permission or access needed]
- Complete [prerequisite task](link) if you haven't already

## [Main task]

Choose the method that works best for your scenario:

### Use the [interface name]

The easiest way to [task] is through the [interface].

1. Go to the [location] in the [interface].

2. Find your [resource] in the list.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't see your [resource], make sure you selected the correct [filter/scope].

3. Select **[Action]** > **[Specific option]**.

4. Configure these settings:

   | Setting | Value | Description |
   |---------|--------|-------------|
   | **Name** | *Your choice* | A descriptive name for [purpose] |
   | **Type** | *Standard* | For most scenarios, use Standard |
   | **Size** | *Medium* | Balance between performance and cost |

5. Select **Review + create**.

6. Review your settings, then select **Create**.

### Use the command line

If you prefer working from the command line, or need to automate this task:

```bash
# Set your variables
RESOURCE_NAME="your-resource-name"
LOCATION="eastus"

# Create the resource
az resource create \
  --name $RESOURCE_NAME \
  --location $LOCATION \
  --type Standard \
  --size Medium
````

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace the example values with your actual values. The location must be a valid Azure region.

## Verify results

Make sure your [task] completed successfully:

1. Go to the [location] to view your new [resource].

2. Check that the status shows as *Ready* or *Active*.

3. Test the [resource] by [specific test action].

If something doesn't look right, see [Troubleshoot common issues](#troubleshooting).

## Clean up resources

To avoid unnecessary charges, remove resources you no longer need:

> [!WARNING]
> This permanently deletes your [resource] and all associated data.

1. Select your [resource].
2. Select **Delete**.
3. Type the resource name to confirm.
4. Select **Delete**.

## Troubleshooting

### [Resource] not appearing

- Wait 2-3 minutes and refresh the page
- Check you're in the correct [scope/filter]
- Verify you have permission to view [resources]

### Creation fails with error "[specific error]"

This usually means [explanation]. To fix it:

1. [Solution step 1]
2. [Solution step 2]

## Next steps

- [Learn about advanced features](link)
- [Configure security settings](link)
- [Set up monitoring](link)

```markdown
# Understand [concept/technology]

[Engaging introduction that explains why this topic matters to the reader]

**In this article**
- [What is [concept]?](#what-is-concept)
- [How it works](#how-it-works)
- [When to use it](#when-to-use-it)
- [Best practices](#best-practices)

## What is [concept]?

[Clear, simple definition followed by a relatable analogy if helpful]

Think of [concept] like [familiar analogy]. Just as [analogy explanation], [concept] helps you [benefit/purpose].

### Key benefits

- **[Benefit 1]**: [How it helps users]
- **[Benefit 2]**: [Specific advantage]
- **[Benefit 3]**: [Business or technical value]

## How it works

[High-level explanation using diagrams where helpful]

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Request] --> B[Component 1]
    B --> C[Component 2]
    C --> D[Result]
```

Let's break this down:

1. **User Request**: When you [action], the system [what happens].

2. **Processing**: The [component] takes your request and [explanation].

3. **Result**: You get [outcome], which you can use to [purpose].

### Under the hood

For those interested in the technical details:

[Deeper technical explanation with specific implementation details]

## When to use it

[Concept] works best when:

- ‚úÖ You need to [scenario 1]

- ‚úÖ You want to [goal]

Consider alternatives when:

- ‚ùå Your use case involves [conflicting scenario]
- ‚ùå You need [different requirement]
- ‚ùå Performance is critical for [specific operation]

## Compare with similar approaches

| Approach            | Best for          | Limitations           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| **[This concept]**  | [Use cases]       | [Tradeoffs]           |
| **[Alternative 1]** | [Different cases] | [Different tradeoffs] |
| **[Alternative 2]** | [Other cases]     | [Other tradeoffs]     |

## Best practices

## Documentation Planning

Before writing, consider:

1. **Audience**: Who needs this information?
2. **Purpose**: What will they do with it?
3. **Context**: When will they need it?
4. **Format**: What type of document serves them best?

Remember: Good documentation anticipates user needs and removes barriers to success. Write with empathy, clarity, and
respect for your readers' time and expertise.
