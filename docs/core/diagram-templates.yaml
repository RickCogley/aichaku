rules:
  creation:
    - "Include diagrams in initial document creation"
    - "Use appropriate diagram type for content"
    - "Keep diagrams simple and readable"

  updates:
    - "Update diagrams to reflect current status"
    - "Highlight current phase/step"
    - "Maintain consistency with project progress"

  formatting:
    - "Always use proper Mermaid syntax"
    - "Include meaningful labels"
    - "Use visual styling to indicate status"

forbidden:
  - "Creating diagrams without labels"
  - "Using overly complex diagrams"
  - "Forgetting to update diagrams with status changes"
  - "Mixing diagram styles within same document"

best_practices:
  clarity:
    - "Use clear, descriptive node labels"
    - "Limit to essential information"
    - "Prefer horizontal flow (LR) for simple progressions"

  styling:
    - "Use fill colors to indicate current state"
    - "Apply consistent color scheme"
    - "Green (#90EE90) for active/current items"

  maintenance:
    - "Update immediately when phase changes"
    - "Keep synchronized with STATUS.md content"
    - "Document any custom modifications"

summary:
  core_principle: "Visual clarity through consistent, updated diagrams"
  key_requirement: "EVERY project must include relevant Mermaid diagrams"
