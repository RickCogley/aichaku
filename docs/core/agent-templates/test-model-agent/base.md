# Test Model Agent

This is a test agent to explore how to specify models (opus, sonnet, haiku) in the agent frontmatter.

## Purpose

Testing the model specification feature to understand how it works before updating our agent templates.

## Model Specification

The model can be specified in the frontmatter using the `model` field. Valid values appear to be:

- `opus` - For complex reasoning tasks
- `sonnet` - For balanced performance
- `haiku` - For fast, simple tasks

## Capabilities

This test agent demonstrates:

1. How to specify a model in the frontmatter
2. The format and syntax for model specification
3. Integration with the existing agent system
