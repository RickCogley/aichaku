description: "Project structure, file paths, and naming conventions for Aichaku"

project_structure:
  root: "docs/projects/"
  description: "All Aichaku projects live under this directory"

  states:
    active:
      path: "docs/projects/active/"
      description: "Currently active projects"
      naming: "active-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-kebab-case-name}"
      example: "active-2025-07-15-security-workflow-modernization"

    done:
      path: "docs/projects/done/"
      description: "Completed projects"
      naming: "done-YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-kebab-case-name}"
      example: "done-2025-07-14-consistent-branding"
      transition: "Rename from active-* to done-* when complete"

required_files:
  STATUS.md:
    description: "Project status tracking with lifecycle diagram"
    created: "FIRST file created in any new project"
    contains:
      - "Project phase and progress"
      - "Mermaid lifecycle diagram"
      - "Current status and next steps"

  methodology_specific:
    shape_up:
      - "pitch.md"
      - "cycle-plan.md"
      - "hill-chart.md"
    scrum:
      - "sprint-planning.md"
      - "user-story.md"
      - "sprint-retrospective.md"
    kanban:
      - "kanban-board.md"
      - "flow-metrics.md"
    lean:
      - "experiment-plan.md"
      - "metrics-dashboard.md"

  completion_files:
    change_log:
      naming: "YYYY-MM-DD-{Project-Name}-CHANGE-LOG.md"
      description: "Summary of all changes when completing work"
      example: "2025-07-15-Security-Workflow-CHANGE-LOG.md"
      rules:
        - "Use TODAY'S date from environment info"
        - "Include descriptive project name"
        - "NEVER just 'CHANGE-LOG.md'"

naming_conventions:
  projects:
    format: "YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-kebab-case-name}"
    date_source: "TODAY'S date from environment (not example dates)"
    case: "kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)"
    examples:
      good:
        - "2025-07-15-yaml-integration-redesign"
        - "2025-07-14-security-architecture-modernization"
      bad:
        - "yaml-integration" # Missing date
        - "2025-01-15-test" # Using wrong month
        - "YAML_Integration" # Wrong case

  documents:
    format: "{methodology-specific-name}.md"
    case: "kebab-case for filenames"
    extension: "Always .md for documentation"

lifecycle_management:
  starting_work:
    steps:
      - "CHECK TODAY'S DATE from environment info"
      - "Create: docs/projects/active/YYYY-MM-DD-{descriptive-name}/"
      - "Create STATUS.md immediately with status diagram"
      - "Read appropriate methodology guides"
      - "Create planning documents with workflow diagrams"
      - "WAIT for human approval before coding"

    common_mistakes:
      - "Using 01 instead of current month"
      - "Using example dates instead of today's date"
      - "Creating files in project root"

  during_work:
    - "Update STATUS.md regularly"
    - "Create supporting documents freely"
    - "Keep all work within project folder"

  completing_work:
    steps:
      - "Create YYYY-MM-DD-{Project-Name}-CHANGE-LOG.md"
      - "Update final diagram states"
      - "Rename folder: active-* â†’ done-*"
      - "Ask: 'Work appears complete. Shall I commit and push?'"
      - "Use conventional commits"

forbidden_locations:
  - path: "/"
    reason: "Never create documents in project root"
  - path: ".claude/user/"
    reason: "That's for user customizations only"
  - path: "src/"
    reason: "Documentation belongs in docs/"

error_recovery:
  wrong_location:
    detection: "File created outside docs/projects/"
    action: "Move immediately: mv [file] docs/projects/active/*/"
    followup: "Update STATUS.md noting the correction"
    behavior: "Continue without asking - this is AUTOMATIC"

summary:
  core_principle: "Consistent, dated project organization with clear lifecycle"
  key_rule: "All project documentation lives under docs/projects/"
  date_critical: "ALWAYS use TODAY'S actual date from environment"
