# Setting Up the Aichaku MCP Server

Learn how to install and configure the Aichaku MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for automated code review in Claude Code. This tutorial covers first-time setup and verification.

## What you'll learn

In this tutorial, you'll:
- Install the Aichaku MCP server globally
- Configure Claude Code to use the MCP server
- Verify the installation is working
- Understand what the MCP server provides
- Test automated code review with Claude

## Before you begin

You need:
- **Aichaku installed** (run `aichaku --version` to check)
- **Claude Code** with MCP support
- **Admin access** to install global tools
- **10 minutes** to complete this tutorial

Don't have Aichaku? Follow the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide first.

## Understanding MCP

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets Claude Code use external tools. The Aichaku MCP server provides:

- **Security scanning** - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability detection
- **Standards checking** - TDD, SOLID, conventional commits, etc.
- **Methodology validation** - Shape Up, Scrum, Kanban compliance
- **Educational feedback** - Learning opportunities, not just errors
- **Privacy-first** - All scanning happens locally on your machine

## Step 1: Install the MCP server

Install the Aichaku MCP server globally:

```bash
aichaku mcp --install
```

This downloads the correct binary for your platform and installs it to `~/.aichaku/mcp-server/`.

### What happens during installation

The installer:
1. Detects your operating system and architecture
2. Downloads the pre-compiled binary from GitHub releases
3. Saves it to `~/.aichaku/mcp-server/mcp-code-reviewer`
4. Makes it executable (on Unix-like systems)
5. Checks for optional external scanners

### Verify the installation

Check that the MCP server installed correctly:

```bash
aichaku mcp --status
```

You should see:
```
üîç Checking MCP Server Status...

üì¶ MCP Server: ‚úÖ Installed
   Location: /Users/yourname/.aichaku/mcp-server/mcp-code-reviewer

üîç External Scanners:
   CodeQL: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Not installed
      Install: brew install codeql
   DevSkim: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Not installed
      Install: dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CST.DevSkim.CLI
   Semgrep: ‚ö†Ô∏è  Not installed
      Install: brew install semgrep
```

The external scanners are optional but provide enhanced security checking.

## Step 2: Configure Claude Code

Get the configuration for Claude Code:

```bash
aichaku mcp --config
```

This shows you the exact configuration to add to Claude Code's settings.

### Add to Claude Code settings

1. **Find your Claude Code settings file:**
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_settings.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_settings.json`
   - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_settings.json`

2. **Open the settings file** in your text editor

3. **Add the MCP server configuration:**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "aichaku-reviewer": {
         "command": "/Users/yourname/.aichaku/mcp-server/mcp-code-reviewer",
         "args": [],
         "env": {}
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Save the file** and restart Claude Code

### Verify Claude Code configuration

After restarting Claude Code:

1. Open any project with Aichaku initialized
2. Ask Claude: "Can you check what MCP tools are available?"
3. Claude should list:
   - `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__review_file`
   - `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__review_methodology`
   - `mcp__aichaku-reviewer__get_standards`

If you don't see these tools, check:
- The settings file path is correct
- The JSON syntax is valid (no trailing commas)
- Claude Code was fully restarted

## Step 3: Test the MCP server

Create a test file with a security issue:

```bash
cat > test-security.js << 'EOF'
// Test file with intentional security issues
const userInput = process.argv[2];
const exec = require('child_process').exec;

// Command injection vulnerability
exec(`echo ${userInput}`, (error, stdout) => {
  console.log(stdout);
});

// Hardcoded secret
const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdef";

// SQL injection
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '${userInput}'`;
EOF
```

Now ask Claude to review it:

```
"Please review test-security.js for security issues"
```

Claude will use the MCP server to:
1. Scan for security vulnerabilities
2. Check against your project standards
3. Provide educational feedback with fixes

## Understanding the feedback

The MCP server provides comprehensive feedback:

üìñ Context: Command injection is one of the most critical security vulnerabilities...

‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Using shell variables directly in commands
üìå Reminder: Your CLAUDE.md requires preventing command injection

‚ùå Bad Example:
exec(`echo ${userInput}`)

‚úÖ Good Example:
execFile('echo', [userInput])

üîÑ Step-by-Step Fix:
1. Replace exec with execFile for parameterized execution
2. Use array arguments instead of string interpolation
...
```

This educational approach helps you:
- Understand why something is a problem
- Learn the secure alternative
- Apply the fix with confidence
- Remember for next time

## Optional: Install external scanners

For enhanced security scanning, install external tools:

### macOS

```bash
# Install Homebrew if needed
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install scanners
brew install codeql semgrep

# Install DevSkim (requires .NET)
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CST.DevSkim.CLI
```

### Linux

```bash
# Semgrep
python3 -m pip install semgrep

# CodeQL
# Download from: https://github.com/github/codeql-cli-binaries

# DevSkim
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CST.DevSkim.CLI
```

### Windows

```powershell
# Semgrep
pip install semgrep

# DevSkim
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.CST.DevSkim.CLI

# CodeQL - download from GitHub releases
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP server not found in Claude

**Problem:** Claude doesn't see the MCP tools

**Solutions:**
1. Verify the settings file location is correct
2. Check JSON syntax (use a JSON validator)
3. Ensure the binary path in settings is absolute
4. Restart Claude Code completely (quit and reopen)

### Installation fails

**Problem:** Binary download fails

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try the manual installation:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RickCogley/aichaku
   cd aichaku/mcp-server
   deno task compile
   cp dist/mcp-code-reviewer ~/.aichaku/mcp-server/
   ```

### Reviews not working

**Problem:** Claude can see the tools but reviews fail

**Solutions:**
1. Check file permissions on the MCP binary
2. Run `aichaku mcp --status` to verify installation
3. Check Claude's developer console for errors
4. Ensure the project has Aichaku initialized
