guidance:
  spirit: |
    Ethical design recognizes that designers have power and responsibility.
    Every design decision has potential consequences for users and society.
    The goal is to create technology that serves humanity rather than
    exploiting it.
  questions_to_ask:
    - "How might this design affect user wellbeing?"
    - "Are we being transparent about how this works?"
    - "What are the unintended consequences of this feature?"
    - "Are we respecting user autonomy and choice?"
  when_to_apply:
    - "All product design and development"
    - "Social media and engagement platforms"
    - "Data collection and privacy decisions"
    - "AI and algorithmic systems"
  exceptions:
    - "Some business pressures may conflict with ethical principles"
    - "Legal compliance may set minimum rather than optimal standards"
  common_mistakes:
    - "Prioritizing metrics over user wellbeing"
    - "Using dark patterns to increase conversions"
    - "Not considering diverse user impacts"

      code: |
        Screen Time Controls:
        - Show usage statistics
        - Allow users to set limits
        - Provide gentle reminders
        - Make it easy to take breaks
        
        Notification Design:
        - Bundle non-urgent notifications
        - Respect "do not disturb" settings
        - Allow granular control
        - Default to less intrusive options
      explanation: "Helps users maintain healthy relationships with technology"
  bad:
    - description: "Dark patterns in e-commerce"
      code: |
        Manipulative techniques:
        - Fake scarcity ("Only 2 left!")
        - Hidden costs revealed at checkout
        - Pre-checked subscription boxes
        - Making cancellation extremely difficult
        - Shame language for declining offers
      problem: "Exploits psychological biases to manipulate user behavior"
