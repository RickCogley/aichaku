name: Accessibility First
category: human-centered
description: Design and develop products that are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities, from the very beginning of the process rather than as an afterthought.
aliases:
  - a11y-first
  - inclusive-accessibility

history:
  origin: "1990s, Disability Rights Movement"
  originators:
    - "Tim Berners-Lee"
    - "Disability rights advocates"
    - "Section 508 legislation"
    - "W3C Web Accessibility Initiative"
  evolution: |
    Accessibility First emerged from the broader disability rights movement and
    the recognition that digital products must be inclusive from the start.
    The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) formalized many practices.
  significance: |
    Critical for creating truly inclusive digital experiences that serve all users,
    not just those without disabilities. Improves usability for everyone.

summary:
  tagline: "Accessibility is not a feature, it's a foundation"
  core_tenets:
    - text: "Design for everyone from the start"
      guidance: "Consider accessibility in every design decision, not as an afterthought"
    - text: "Follow WCAG guidelines"
      guidance: "Implement WCAG 2.1 AA standards as minimum requirements"
    - text: "Test with real users"
      guidance: "Include users with disabilities in testing and feedback processes"
    - text: "Use semantic markup"
      guidance: "Proper HTML structure supports assistive technologies"
  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Retrofitting accessibility"
      instead: "Building accessibility in from the beginning"
    - pattern: "Assuming sighted, hearing users"
      instead: "Designing for diverse abilities and contexts"
    - pattern: "Relying only on color"
      instead: "Using multiple indicators (color, shape, text, icons)"
  key_practices:
    - "Alt text for all images"
    - "Keyboard navigation support"
    - "Proper heading structure"
    - "Sufficient color contrast"
    - "Focus indicators"
    - "Error handling and form labels"

guidance:
  spirit: |
    Accessibility First means recognizing that disability is part of human
    diversity, and that accessible design often results in better experiences
    for everyone. It's about removing barriers and creating inclusive experiences.
  questions_to_ask:
    - "Can this be used without seeing it?"
    - "Can this be navigated with only a keyboard?"
    - "Are instructions clear and simple?"
    - "Does this work with screen readers?"
    - "Is the color contrast sufficient?"
  when_to_apply:
    - "All digital product development"
    - "Website and application design"
    - "Content creation and publishing"
    - "User interface design"
    - "Information architecture"
  exceptions:
    - "Highly specialized tools may have different requirements"
    - "Some visual content may need alternative formats"
  common_mistakes:
    - "Only considering obvious disabilities"
    - "Testing accessibility only at the end"
    - "Assuming accessibility means ugly design"

examples:
  good:
    - description: "Accessible form design"
      code: |
        <form>
          <label for="email">Email Address (required)</label>
          <input
            type="email"
            id="email"
            required
            aria-describedby="email-error"
            aria-invalid="false"
          >
          <div id="email-error" role="alert"></div>
        </form>
      explanation: "Proper labels, ARIA attributes, and error handling"

    - description: "Accessible button"
      code: |
        <button
          type="button"
          aria-label="Close dialog"
          aria-expanded="true"
          onclick="closeDialog()"
        >
          <span aria-hidden="true">Ã—</span>
        </button>
      explanation: "Clear purpose, keyboard accessible, screen reader friendly"

  bad:
    - description: "Inaccessible design"
      code: |
        <div onclick="submit()">Click here</div>
        <img src="chart.png">
        <span style="color: red">Error</span>
      problem: "No keyboard access, missing alt text, color-only error indication"
