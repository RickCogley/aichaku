name: "Privacy by Design"
category: human-centered
description: |
  A privacy framework that embeds privacy considerations into the design and operation of systems from the outset, rather than as an afterthought.

history:
  origin: "1990s, Ann Cavoukian"
  originators:
    - "Ann Cavoukian"
    - "Information and Privacy Commissioner of Ontario"
  evolution: |
    Developed by Ann Cavoukian in the 1990s and formalized through seven
    foundational principles. Gained international recognition and was
    incorporated into major privacy regulations like GDPR.
  significance: |
    Fundamental to modern privacy protection, influencing legislation and
    becoming essential for building user trust in digital systems.

      guidance: "Anticipate and prevent privacy invasions before they occur"
    - text: "Privacy as the default"

    - text: "Full functionality"
      guidance: "Privacy protection doesn't compromise system functionality"
  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Collecting data first, considering privacy later"
      instead: "Design data collection with privacy in mind from the start"
    - pattern: "Opt-out privacy settings"
      instead: "Privacy-protective defaults that require opt-in for data sharing"
  key_practices:
    - "Data minimization and purpose limitation"
    - "Strong security measures and encryption"
    - "Transparent privacy policies and practices"
    - "User control over personal data"

guidance:
  spirit: |
    Privacy by Design recognizes privacy as a fundamental human right that
    should be protected by default. It's about building systems that respect
    user privacy without requiring users to be privacy experts.
  questions_to_ask:
    - "What personal data do we actually need to collect?"
    - "How can we minimize data collection and retention?"
    - "Are privacy protections enabled by default?"
    - "Can users easily understand and control their privacy?"
  when_to_apply:
    - "All systems that handle personal data"
    - "Product design and development"
    - "Data architecture and infrastructure"
    - "Business model and strategy decisions"
  exceptions:
    - "Some business models may conflict with privacy principles"
    - "Legal requirements may mandate certain data collection"
  common_mistakes:
    - "Treating privacy as a compliance checkbox"
    - "Overwhelming users with complex privacy controls"
    - "Collecting data 'just in case' it might be useful"

examples:
  good:

      code: |
        Design principles:
        - End-to-end encryption by default
        - No message storage on servers
        - Minimal metadata collection
        - Anonymous account creation
        - Open source for transparency
        
        User experience:
        - Privacy protection is invisible to users
        - No complex privacy settings to configure
        - Clear communication about what data is protected
      explanation: "Privacy protection built into the core architecture"
  bad:
    - description: "Data-harvesting social platform"
      code: |
        Problems:
        - Collects data from all user interactions
        - Shares data with third parties by default
        - Complex, buried privacy settings
        - Opt-out instead of opt-in for data sharing
        - Vague privacy policy language
        
        User impact:
        - Users unaware of data collection extent
        - Difficulty controlling personal information
        - Privacy violations and breaches
      problem: "Privacy treated as obstacle to data collection rather than core value"

  description: |
    A framework that embeds privacy considerations into the design and operation of IT systems, networked infrastructure, and business practices from the very beginning, rather than as an afterthought.
  
  core_concept: |
    Privacy by Design (PbD) is a concept developed by Dr. Ann Cavoukian that takes a proactive rather than reactive approach to privacy. It anticipates and prevents privacy invasions before they occur, making privacy the default setting in any system or business practice.
