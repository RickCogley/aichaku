name: "Inclusive Design"
category: human-centered
description: |
  A design methodology that creates products, services, and environments that are usable by as many people as possible, regardless of age, ability, or situation, without the need for special adaptation.

history:
  origin: "2000s, Inclusive Design Research"
  originators:
    - "Jutta Treviranus"
    - "Microsoft Inclusive Design Team"
    - "IDEO"
  evolution: |
    Evolved from universal design principles, with significant contributions from
    accessibility research and human-centered design. Microsoft's inclusive design
    toolkit and methodology have been influential in spreading these practices.
  significance: |
    Represents a shift from designing for the "average" user to designing for
    human diversity, leading to more innovative and broadly applicable solutions.

summary:
  tagline: "Design for diversity and uniqueness to create broadly beneficial solutions"
  core_tenets:
    - text: "Recognize diversity and uniqueness"
      guidance: "Understand that there is no average user"
    - text: "Inclusive process and tools"
      guidance: "Involve diverse perspectives in the design process"
    - text: "Broader beneficial impact"
      guidance: "Solutions for edge cases often benefit mainstream users"
  anti_patterns:
    - pattern: "Designing for the average user"
      instead: "Design for diverse needs and contexts"
    - pattern: "Adding accessibility as an afterthought"
      instead: "Build inclusion into the core design"
  key_practices:
    - "Involve users with diverse abilities in design"
    - "Consider temporary and situational disabilities"
    - "Design for multiple interaction modalities"
    - "Test with diverse user groups"

guidance:
  spirit: |
    Inclusive design is about recognizing that exclusion happens when we solve
    problems using our own biases. By including diverse perspectives and designing
    for edge cases, we create solutions that work better for everyone.
  questions_to_ask:
    - "Who might be excluded by this design?"
    - "How might this work differently for users with diverse abilities?"
    - "What assumptions are we making about our users?"
    - "How can we involve more diverse voices in this process?"
  when_to_apply:
    - "All design and development projects"
    - "Product strategy and planning"
    - "Team composition and processes"
    - "User research and testing"
  exceptions:
    - "Some specialized tools may have inherent limitations"
    - "Resource constraints may require prioritization"
  common_mistakes:
    - "Assuming accessibility equals inclusion"
    - "Designing for stereotypes rather than real diversity"
    - "Not involving diverse users in the design process"

examples:
  good:
    - description: "Xbox Adaptive Controller"
      code: |
        Problem: Traditional game controllers exclude users with limited mobility

        Inclusive approach:
        - Interviewed gamers with diverse abilities
        - Designed modular, customizable interface
        - Created ecosystem of compatible accessories
        - Made standard gaming accessible

        Impact:
        - Opened gaming to new audiences
        - Improved gaming for all users (customization)
        - Industry recognition and adoption
      explanation: "Solving for specific needs created broader innovation"
  bad:
    - description: "One-size-fits-all approach"
      code: |
        Problem: Voice interface that only works in quiet environments

        Exclusive result:
        - Excludes users in noisy environments
        - Excludes users with speech differences
        - Excludes users who prefer not to speak aloud

        Better approach:
        - Multimodal interaction (voice + touch + text)
        - Noise cancellation and speech recognition improvement
        - Visual feedback and confirmation
      problem: "Single solution excludes many users and use cases"
