# Schema Validation Libraries for Deno: Technical Report

## Executive Summary

Zod remains a strong choice for TypeScript schema validation in Deno environments, but lacks native JSR support. Typebox
stands as the only major validation library available on JSR, while newer alternatives like Valibot and ArkType offer
compelling tradeoffs for specific use cases.

## Current Landscape

### What is Runtime Schema Validation?

Schema validation libraries provide runtime type checking for TypeScript applications, ensuring data matches expected
types beyond compile-time checks. Think of them as security checkpoints that verify data structure and content at
runtime.

## Library Comparison

### Zod

**Status:** ❌ Not on JSR | Available via `npm:` specifier\
**Bundle Size:** ~60kb minified\
**Maturity:** Stable, widely adopted

**Strengths:**

- Exceptional TypeScript inference
- Rich ecosystem and integrations
- Composable schema design
- Extensive documentation
- Active community support

**Weaknesses:**

- Larger bundle size
- Performance overhead for complex schemas
- Not available on JSR

**Best For:** Server-side applications where DX matters more than bundle size

### Valibot

**Status:** ❌ Not on JSR | Available via `npm:` specifier\
**Bundle Size:** ~20kb minified\
**Maturity:** Growing rapidly

**Strengths:**

- 3x smaller than Zod
- Tree-shakeable architecture
- Similar API to Zod
- Optimized for edge deployments

**Weaknesses:**

- Younger ecosystem
- Fewer third-party integrations
- Limited documentation compared to Zod

**Best For:** Edge functions and Deno Deploy where bundle size is critical

### ArkType

**Status:** ❌ Not on JSR | Available via `npm:` specifier\
**Bundle Size:** ~50kb minified\
**Maturity:** Beta

**Strengths:**

- TypeScript-like syntax feels native
- Exceptional runtime performance
- Innovative approach to validation

**Weaknesses:**

- Still in beta
- Smaller community
- Learning curve for unique syntax

**Best For:** Projects prioritizing performance and TypeScript-native syntax

### Typebox

**Status:** ✅ Available on JSR\
**Bundle Size:** ~40kb minified\
**Maturity:** Stable

**Strengths:**

- Only major validation library on JSR
- Generates JSON Schema natively
- Excellent OpenAPI integration
- First-class Deno support

**Weaknesses:**

- More verbose API than Zod
- Less intuitive for complex validations

**Best For:** API-first projects requiring JSON Schema/OpenAPI compatibility

## Import Methods

```typescript
// Typebox (JSR - Recommended for JSR-first projects)
import { Type } from "jsr:@sinclair/typebox@0.32.0";

// Zod (npm specifier - Most common approach)
import { z } from "npm:zod@3.23.8";

// Valibot (npm specifier)
import * as v from "npm:valibot@0.42.0";

// ArkType (npm specifier)
import { type } from "npm:arktype@2.0.0";
```

## Performance & Size Comparison

```
Bundle Size:    Native < Valibot < Typebox < ArkType < Zod
                 0kb     20kb      40kb      50kb     60kb

Performance:    ArkType > Native > Valibot > Zod > Typebox
                Fastest                              Slower

DX/Features:    Native < Typebox < Valibot ≈ Zod ≈ ArkType
                Basic    Good       Excellent
```

## Decision Matrix

| Use Case                | Recommended Library | Rationale                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| General server-side app | Zod                 | Mature, excellent DX, ecosystem     |
| Deno Deploy/Edge        | Valibot             | Smallest bundle, good performance   |
| JSR-native requirement  | Typebox             | Only option with native JSR support |
| OpenAPI/JSON Schema     | Typebox             | Built-in JSON Schema generation     |
| Performance critical    | ArkType             | Fastest runtime validation          |
| Minimal dependencies    | Native Deno         | Zero external dependencies          |

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation

**Use Zod via `npm:` specifier** unless you have specific constraints. It offers the best balance of features,
documentation, and community support.

### Alternative Recommendations

1. **Choose Typebox if:**
   - JSR-native packaging is required
   - You need JSON Schema generation
   - Working with OpenAPI specifications

2. **Choose Valibot if:**
   - Deploying to edge environments
   - Bundle size is critical (under 25kb requirement)
   - You like Zod's API but need smaller footprint

3. **Choose ArkType if:**
   - Runtime performance is paramount
   - You prefer TypeScript-like syntax
   - Willing to work with beta software

## Migration Considerations

The validation library ecosystem on JSR is still maturing. Most libraries are accessible via `npm:` specifiers with
minimal overhead. Consider these factors:

- **npm: specifier overhead:** Generally negligible for server applications
- **Future JSR migration:** Libraries are gradually adopting JSR
- **Lock file compatibility:** Ensure your team uses consistent import methods

## Conclusion

While Zod lacks JSR support, it remains the most practical choice for most Deno projects via `npm:` specifier. Typebox
offers the best JSR-native experience, while Valibot and ArkType provide compelling alternatives for specific
optimization needs.

The "best" choice depends on your priorities: developer experience (Zod), JSR compatibility (Typebox), bundle size
(Valibot), or performance (ArkType).
