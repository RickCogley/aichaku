## Summary

Comprehensive CLI enhancement project to fix legacy file creation issues and
implement structured contextual guidance for all change-making commands. This
builds on the successful architecture consolidation (v0.33.0) to provide
exceptional user experience.

## Key Objectives

### 1. **Critical Bug Fixes**

- ✅ Remove RULES-REMINDER.md creation from init command
- ✅ Fix help screen bypassing in upgrade, integrate, cleanup commands
- ✅ Test and verify standards --remove functionality
- ✅ Verify advanced commands (GitHub, hooks, review)

### 2. **Enhanced Contextual Guidance**

- ✅ Audit all change-making commands for guidance patterns
- ✅ Add "what did I do and where" context to all operations
- ✅ Add "what's next" structured guidance
- ✅ Implement visual diagrams for spatial awareness

## Current Status

### **Foundation Complete** ✅

- **Configuration-as-Code**: All hardcoded lists eliminated
- **Branding Consistency**: All console.log calls fixed to use Brand.\*
- **Legacy File Elimination**: RULES-REMINDER.md creation completely removed
- **Test Data Cleanup**: Production config cleaned of test artifacts

### **Senior Engineer Quality Standards Applied** ✅

- Created `src/config/methodology-fallback.ts` for fallback configuration
- Created `src/config/methodology-defaults.ts` for default methodology lists
- Created `src/config/methodology-templates.ts` for template mappings
- Single source of truth for all configuration data
- Consistent `🪴 Aichaku:` branding across all commands

### **Pre-flight Testing Complete** ✅

- ✅ Fixed 6 linting errors (unused parameters and imports)
- ✅ Fixed 3 TypeScript type checking errors in cli.ts
- ✅ All 36 tests passing
- ✅ Code ready for documentation updates and commit

### **Current Status: Final Documentation & Commit**

- Update project documentation with implementation details
- Update central docs (@README.md and @docs/)
- Commit changes in logical groups as requested

## Impact Goals

### **User Experience**

- **Spatial awareness**: Users know exactly where changes occurred
- **Confidence**: Clear understanding of what happened
- **Actionability**: Structured next steps for every operation
- **Visual clarity**: Diagrams for file relationships and structures

### **Technical Excellence**

- **No legacy files**: Complete elimination of outdated formats
- **Consistent help**: All commands respect --help flag
- **Unified patterns**: Consistent guidance across all commands
- **Visual aids**: Directory trees and process flows

## Success Metrics

- **Zero legacy files created** in any command
- **100% help screen compliance** for all commands
- **Structured guidance** for all change-making operations
- **Visual diagrams** for spatial context
- **Enhanced user confidence** through clear communication
