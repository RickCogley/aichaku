# Cycle Plan: Release Automation Enhancement

## Cycle Overview
- **Duration**: 4 days
- **Team**: 1 developer
- **Start Date**: 2025-07-16
- **End Date**: 2025-07-19

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1: Foundation & Validation Framework
**Morning (4 hours)**
- [ ] Create `scripts/release/` directory structure
- [ ] Implement `release.config.ts` with configuration schema
- [ ] Build pre-flight validation framework
  - [ ] Type checking validator with Deno context
  - [ ] Git state validator (branch, clean tree)
  - [ ] Version consistency checker
  - [ ] Registry readiness checker

**Afternoon (4 hours)**
- [ ] Implement validation runners
  - [ ] Test runner with coverage check
  - [ ] Lint runner
  - [ ] Security scanner integration
- [ ] Create validation result aggregator
- [ ] Build validation CLI with progress indicators

### Day 2: Release Orchestration Core
**Morning (4 hours)**
- [ ] Design release state machine
- [ ] Implement release orchestrator class
- [ ] Build registry publishers
  - [ ] NPM publisher with retry logic
  - [ ] JSR publisher with retry logic
  - [ ] Version synchronization

**Afternoon (4 hours)**
- [ ] Implement git operations
  - [ ] Tag creation and verification
  - [ ] Automatic tag pushing
  - [ ] Commit message generation
- [ ] Add rollback mechanism
- [ ] Create release state persistence

### Day 3: Binary Management & GitHub Integration
**Morning (4 hours)**
- [ ] Implement binary builder
  - [ ] Multi-platform compilation
  - [ ] Binary verification
  - [ ] Checksum generation
- [ ] Create GitHub release manager
  - [ ] Release creation API integration
  - [ ] Asset upload with progress

**Afternoon (4 hours)**
- [ ] Build error recovery system
  - [ ] Intelligent retry logic
  - [ ] Partial failure handling
  - [ ] Clear error messaging
- [ ] Implement dry-run mode
- [ ] Add release resumption capability

### Day 4: Integration & Polish
**Morning (4 hours)**
- [ ] Create unified `deno task release` command
- [ ] Integrate all components
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Build release status dashboard
- [ ] Implement progress notifications

**Afternoon (4 hours)**
- [ ] Testing and bug fixes
  - [ ] End-to-end release testing
  - [ ] Error scenario testing
  - [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Update release process docs
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Final polish and cleanup

## Success Metrics
1. **Zero Manual Steps**: Complete release with single command
2. **Fast Feedback**: All validations complete in <30 seconds
3. **Reliable Publishing**: 100% success rate with retry logic
4. **Clear Communication**: Actionable error messages
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing commands still work

## Risk Mitigation
- **JSR API Changes**: Abstract registry interfaces for flexibility
- **Type Checking Complexity**: Start with basic checks, iterate
- **Platform Differences**: Test on all major platforms early
- **Time Constraints**: Focus on core flow first, enhance later

## Dependencies
- Existing release scripts in `scripts/`
- Deno APIs for process management
- GitHub CLI or API tokens for releases
- NPM and JSR authentication tokens

## Out of Scope
- Changelog generation (separate tool)
- Version bump automation (manual for now)
- CI/CD pipeline changes
- Multi-package support
