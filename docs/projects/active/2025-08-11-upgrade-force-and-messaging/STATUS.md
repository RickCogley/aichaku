## Problem Summary

Users running `aichaku upgrade --global` aren't getting file updates even when new versions are available. The command
reports "files verified/updated" but doesn't actually overwrite existing files. Additionally, the messaging is confusing
with circular warnings.

## Solution Approach

1. Force overwrite files when version differs (no --force needed)
2. Clear "Upgrade available" messaging
3. Real tree output showing actual file structure
4. Separate tracking of updated vs verified files

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Files actually update when upgrading versions
- âœ… No circular "run this command" messages
- âœ… Truth Protocol and other updates delivered automatically
- âœ… Clear distinction between updated and verified files

## Notes

- This is a critical bug affecting all users
- Must maintain backward compatibility with --force flag
- Tree command is optional (provide fallback)
- Security review completed (2025-08-11): Added user confirmation prompt for global upgrades
- User customizations in user/ folder are always preserved
- System files (methodologies, standards, core) are upgraded for security updates
