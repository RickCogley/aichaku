# Project Status: Fix Upgrade Process and Messaging

**Project**: Fix Upgrade Force and Messaging\
**Started**: 2025-08-11\
**Appetite**: Small Batch (2-3 hours)\
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## Current Sprint

### Completed âœ…

- [x] Created Shape Up pitch defining the problem
- [x] Created implementation plan with specific code changes
- [x] Identified all files that need modification

### In Progress ðŸ”„

- [ ] Create feature branch for development
- [ ] Implement force overwrite when versions differ

### Up Next ðŸ“‹

- [ ] Update version mismatch messaging
- [ ] Change "Growing" message to "Seeding"
- [ ] Implement real tree output
- [ ] Track and report updated vs verified files separately
- [ ] Test all upgrade scenarios

## Problem Summary

Users running `aichaku upgrade --global` aren't getting file updates even when new versions are available. The command
reports "files verified/updated" but doesn't actually overwrite existing files. Additionally, the messaging is confusing
with circular warnings.

## Solution Approach

1. Force overwrite files when version differs (no --force needed)
2. Clear "Upgrade available" messaging
3. Real tree output showing actual file structure
4. Separate tracking of updated vs verified files

## Success Metrics

- âœ… Files actually update when upgrading versions
- âœ… No circular "run this command" messages
- âœ… Truth Protocol and other updates delivered automatically
- âœ… Clear distinction between updated and verified files

## Notes

- This is a critical bug affecting all users
- Must maintain backward compatibility with --force flag
- Tree command is optional (provide fallback)
