## Updates
### 2025-07-08T05:45:00Z
- Created project structure
- Identified core issues:
  - Forced to use exact versions
  - No feedback on what was installed
  - Unclear next steps after global upgrade
  - Manual version checking required

- Discovered JSR uses latest when no version specified
- Updated README to clarify no version needed
- Created enhanced install.ts script with version feedback
- Improved upgrade command to show what's new

## Next Steps
1. Test if JSR already supports @latest
2. Implement installation wrapper if needed
3. Enhance CLI feedback
4. Update documentation
