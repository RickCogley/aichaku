# Smooth Upgrade Experience - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The upgrade process was frustrating users with:

- Requirement to specify exact versions (e.g., @0.7.0)
- No feedback about what version was installed
- Unclear next steps after global upgrade
- Manual version tracking from JSR

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Simplified Installation Command

- Discovered JSR automatically uses latest version when no version specified
- Updated README to clarify: `jsr:@rick/aichaku/cli` (no version needed!)

### 2. Enhanced Install Script

Created `scripts/install.ts` that provides:

```
🪴 Aichaku Global Installation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
📦 Current: v0.6.0
📦 Latest:  v0.7.0

🔄 Installing...

✅ Successfully upgraded!

📚 Next steps for your projects:
   • Run 'aichaku init' in new projects
   • Run 'aichaku upgrade' in existing projects
   • Or 'aichaku integrate --force' to update CLAUDE.md

💡 Verify installation: aichaku --version
```

### 3. Improved Upgrade Command

Enhanced `aichaku upgrade` to show:

- Version being upgraded from/to
- What's new in the version
- Clear next steps for projects

### 4. Better CLI Feedback

After global upgrade, CLI now shows:

```
📚 Next steps for your projects:
   • Run 'aichaku upgrade' in each project
   • Or 'aichaku integrate --force' to update CLAUDE.md
```

## Files Modified

1. `README.md` - Clarified upgrade process
2. `scripts/install.ts` - New enhanced installation script
3. `src/commands/upgrade.ts` - Added version changelog display
4. `cli.ts` - Added next steps messaging

## User Experience Impact

- **Before**: Confusing version requirements, silent upgrades
- **After**: Simple commands, clear feedback, actionable next steps

## Future Enhancements

- Could add automatic version checking on CLI startup
- Could integrate release notes from CHANGELOG.md
- Could add `aichaku changelog` command
