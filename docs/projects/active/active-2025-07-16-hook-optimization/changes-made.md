# Hook Optimization Changes

## Date: 2025-07-16

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed aichaku-feedback hook

- **Was**: Running on EVERY tool use with matcher ".*"
- **Impact**: 1,719 calls eliminated (~70% reduction)
- **Reason**: Provided minimal value (just logged "Hook system active ✓")

### 2. Removed commit-validator from PreToolUse

- **Was**: Running on every Bash command (480 calls)
- **Reason**: Only useful for git commits but fired on ALL bash commands
- **Note**: Could be re-added later with specific git command matching

### 3. Removed jsdoc-checker and docs-review from PostToolUse

- **Was**: Running on Write|Edit|MultiEdit (360 calls each)
- **Reason**: Redundant with markdown-review, consolidating functionality
- **Kept**: markdown-review as it provides MCP integration

### 4. Kept Essential Hooks

- **path-validator**: Validates Aichaku file structure (PreToolUse on
  Write|MultiEdit)
- **status-updater**: Shows project activity reminders (PostToolUse)
- **markdown-review**: MCP integration for doc review (PostToolUse)
- **conversation-summary**: Creates checkpoint summaries (PreCompact)

## Files Modified

- Backed up: `~/.claude/settings.json` →
  `~/.claude/settings.json.backup-2025-07-16`
- Created: `~/.claude/settings-optimized.json`
- To apply: `cp ~/.claude/settings-optimized.json ~/.claude/settings.json`

## Expected Impact

- ~80% reduction in hook invocations
- Significant reduction in API usage
- Retained most valuable functionality
- Improved Claude Code performance

## Next Steps

1. Apply the optimized settings
2. Monitor API usage over next session
3. Consider creating a single consolidated PostToolUse hook later
4. Add back commit-validator with proper git command matching if needed
