# Dynamic Content Fetcher - Status

**Project**: Dynamic Content Fetcher for Aichaku  
**Status**: ðŸŒ± Planning  
**Created**: 2025-01-13  
**Appetite**: 6 weeks  

## Current Status

Just created the pitch. This would solve the fragile hard-coded file structure issue that causes confusing error messages during upgrades.

## Problem Summary

Hard-coded file lists in content-fetcher.ts get out of sync with actual repository contents, causing false failure messages and missing files.

## Proposed Solution

Dynamic file listing from GitHub API with bundled manifest fallback.

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine the pitch
2. Prototype GitHub API integration
3. Design manifest generation process
4. Plan migration strategy

- Current issue: "3 files failed" during upgrade (fixed temporarily)
- Missing diagram/Mermaid documentation files (fixed temporarily)
- Future file additions will require code changes (ongoing problem)
