## Current Status

**Phase:** Betting **Start Date:** Not started **Target End:** 6 weeks from start **Risk Level:** Medium

## Problem Statement

Aichaku has accumulated TypeScript antipatterns that bypass type safety:

- 21+ type assertions in cli.ts
- Explicit `any` usage in configuration parsing
- Missing return types on functions
- Non-null assertions without guards

## Solution Overview

Three-layer defense strategy:

1. **Tooling:** Stricter compiler options and linting rules
2. **Refactoring:** Replace assertions with type guards, add validation
3. **Process:** CI/CD enforcement and documentation

## Success Metrics

- Zero `any` types in production
- Zero unguarded type assertions
- 100% return type coverage
- 95% type coverage
- <10% performance impact

## Next Actions

- [ ] Review and approve pitch
- [ ] Assign team resources
- [ ] Begin Week 1: Discovery & Planning

## Notes

- Maintains backward compatibility
- Stays Deno-native
- Internal improvements only (no API changes)
