## Current Phase: Shaping

**Problem identified**: Users report missing location context in
`aichaku upgrade --global` output **Solution approach**: Apply existing visual
guidance framework to upgrade commands

## Current Focus

Creating comprehensive Shape Up pitch document to address user feedback about
upgrade command location context.

**What's working**:

- Clear problem identification from real user feedback
- Existing visual guidance framework provides foundation
- Appetite estimation (6 weeks) aligns with medium-sized enhancement

**Immediate tasks**:

- Complete pitch document with fat marker sketches
- Define implementation scope boundaries
- Identify rabbit holes and no-gos

## Blockers

None currently - proceeding with shaping phase.

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Target scope**: Focus on `aichaku upgrade --global` first (primary user
   feedback)
2. **Technical approach**: Leverage existing `src/utils/visual-guidance.ts`
   framework
3. **Output enhancement**: "What happened and where" + "What's next" guidance
4. **Visual elements**: Directory trees, file counts, spatial awareness

## Next Actions

1. **Complete pitch document** with technical implementation details
2. **Review with stakeholders** (validate approach with team)
3. **Move to betting phase** if pitch is solid
4. **Begin implementation** with focus on src/commands/upgrade.ts

## Risk Assessment

**Low risk enhancement**:

- Builds on existing infrastructure
- Only enhances output, doesn't change upgrade logic
- Addresses immediate user feedback
- Can be implemented incrementally

## Success Metrics

- Users understand exactly where files are installed
- Reduced "where did it install?" support questions
- Consistent location context across all upgrade scenarios
- Visual guidance framework proves its value

## Project Artifacts

- ‚úÖ pitch.md (comprehensive problem/solution definition)
- ‚úÖ STATUS.md (this file - progress tracking)
- üîÑ Technical implementation plan (in progress)
- ‚è≥ Testing strategy (pending)
- ‚è≥ User acceptance criteria (pending)
