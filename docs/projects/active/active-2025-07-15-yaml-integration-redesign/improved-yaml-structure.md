# Improved YAML Structure for CLAUDE.md

## Current Problems

1. **Too Sparse**: The current YAML example lacks context and descriptive information
2. **Missing Directives**: The `METHODOLOGY_SECTION` rules aren't represented in YAML
3. **No Clear Purpose**: Unclear what the YAML is for or how Claude should use it
4. **No References**: No way to access full documentation when needed

## Proposed Enhanced YAML Structure

```yaml

## Key Improvements

1. **Rich Context**: Each item has name, description, and purpose
2. **Directives Included**: All behavioral rules from METHODOLOGY_SECTION in structured format
3. **Clear Organization**: Separates directives, methodologies, and standards
4. **Actionable Information**: Specific triggers, actions, and forbidden behaviors
5. **References**: Points to full documentation without bloating the file
6. **Examples**: Shows exact format for progress displays and diagrams
7. **Metadata**: Version, generation time, and description for context

## Size Comparison

- **Old approach**: Full markdown content = 50KB+
- **New approach**: Rich YAML metadata = ~3-4KB
- **Reduction**: ~92% while maintaining all essential information

## Usage by Claude

When Claude reads this YAML:
1. Immediately understands the behavioral rules (directives)
2. Can detect methodology triggers in conversation
3. Knows exactly what documents to create
4. Has references to full content if needed
5. Can show proper progress indicators
6. Follows the discussion-first approach

The `reference` fields use the path format that Claude can understand, allowing it to request full content when needed without embedding everything in CLAUDE.md.
