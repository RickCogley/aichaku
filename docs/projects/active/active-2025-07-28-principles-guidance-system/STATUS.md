## Current Status

Building phase nearing completion! Weeks 1-4 complete with full CLI, all 18 principles, agent integration, and CLAUDE.md
support. Week 5 now complete with learn command integration - users can now explore principles interactively!

## Completed Work (Week 1-2)

### âœ… CLI Implementation

- Full `aichaku principles` command suite
- Subcommands: list, show, search, category
- Proper branding with ðŸŒ¸ emoji
- Consistent output formatting

### âœ… Data Structures & Loader

- Complete TypeScript interfaces
- PrincipleLoader with caching
- YAML + Markdown dual-file support
- ConfigManager integration

### âœ… All 18 Principles Created

**Software Development (6)**

- âœ… Unix Philosophy
- âœ… DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- âœ… KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- âœ… YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- âœ… SOLID Principles
- âœ… Separation of Concerns

**Organizational (3)**

- âœ… Agile Manifesto
- âœ… Lean Principles
- âœ… Conway's Law

**Engineering (6)**

- âœ… Fail Fast
- âœ… Defensive Programming
- âœ… Robustness Principle
- âœ… Premature Optimization is the Root of All Evil

**Human-Centered (3)**

- âœ… Accessibility First
- âœ… Privacy by Design
- âœ… User-Centered Design
- âœ… Inclusive Design
- âœ… Ethical Design

## Recent Decisions

- Use `--verbose` flag instead of `--examples` for conventional CLI design
- Integrate principles into the `learn` command for interactive tutorials
- Add `--with` flag to show how principles work with specific methodologies
- Principles guide thinking, not enforce rules - gentle suggestions only

## Completed Steps

1. âœ… Design YAML structure for principles
2. âœ… Create execution plan with concrete tasks
3. âœ… Create hill chart for progress tracking
4. âœ… CLI implementation (Week 1)
5. âœ… Create data structures and loader (Week 1)
6. âœ… Create all 18 principles with comprehensive documentation (Week 2)
7. âœ… Test and validate all commands work correctly

## Week 3 Progress (Agent Integration)

### âœ… Completed

- Created principle coach agent template for dedicated principle guidance
- Enhanced agent generator to include contextual principle guidance
- Updated orchestrator to detect principle-related questions and route appropriately
- Added principle-aware sections to security-reviewer and api-architect agents
- Created principle-based examples and delegation patterns
- Built and tested principle integration command

## Week 4 Progress (CLAUDE.md Integration)

### âœ… Completed

- Updated yaml-config-reader.ts to support principles configuration
- Added readPrinciplesConfigs function to read principle YAML files
- Modified integrate command to pass selectedPrinciples to YAML assembler
- Successfully tested integration - principles now appear in CLAUDE.md
- Confirmed 3 test principles (Unix Philosophy, DRY, Accessibility First) are included

## Upcoming Work (Week 5-6)

**Week 4: CLAUDE.md Enhancement** âœ… COMPLETE

- âœ… Update CLAUDE.md generation to include selected principles
- âœ… Add principle-based guidance to user instructions
- âœ… Test integration with real projects

## Week 5 Progress (Learn Command & Documentation)

### âœ… Completed

- Added principles support to learn command with new options:
  - `--principles` to list all principles
  - `--principle-category <category>` to filter by category
  - Topic support for individual principles (e.g., `aichaku learn dry`)
- Implemented principle discovery and display functions
- Created formatted principle help with core tenets, anti-patterns, and compatibility
- Added principles to `--all` resource listing
- Updated CLI parser to handle new principle options
- Fixed development path issues for local testing
- Added cross-references to principle documentation:
  - Related principles, methodologies, and standards
  - Learn more sections with aichaku commands
  - External resources and communities

**Week 5: Documentation & Learn Command** âœ… COMPLETE

- âœ… Integration with learn command for interactive tutorials
- âœ… Enhanced documentation with cross-references
- âœ… All 18 principles accessible via learn command
- âœ… Category filtering and search functionality

**Week 6: Testing & Polish** ðŸš€ IN PROGRESS

- Create comprehensive end-to-end tests for all 18 principles
- Test agent integration and principle-aware responses
- Performance optimization for principle loading
- Fix any remaining bugs and edge cases
- Complete user documentation and release notes
- Prepare for cool-down phase
