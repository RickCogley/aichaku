## Current Status

Building phase has begun! The pitch has been refined with detailed implementation specifications, and work is starting
on the CLI implementation and data structures. The execution plan breaks down the work into 7 major work streams over 6
weeks.

## Key Principles to Add

### Software Development

- [ ] Unix Philosophy
- [ ] DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- [ ] KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- [ ] Zen of Python

### Organizational

- [ ] Agile Manifesto
- [ ] DevOps Three Ways
- [ ] Lean Principles
- [ ] Theory of Constraints
- [ ] Conway's Law

### Engineering

- [ ] Defensive Programming
- [ ] Fail Fast
- [ ] Principle of Least Privilege
- [ ] Separation of Concerns

### Human-Centered

- [ ] Design Thinking
- [ ] Accessibility First
- [ ] Privacy by Design

## Recent Decisions

- Use `--verbose` flag instead of `--examples` for conventional CLI design
- Integrate principles into the `learn` command for interactive tutorials
- Add `--with` flag to show how principles work with specific methodologies
- Principles guide thinking, not enforce rules - gentle suggestions only

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Design YAML structure for principles (completed in pitch)
2. âœ… Create execution plan with concrete tasks
3. âœ… Create hill chart for progress tracking
4. ðŸš§ Start CLI implementation (Week 1)
5. ðŸš§ Create data structures and loader (Week 1)
