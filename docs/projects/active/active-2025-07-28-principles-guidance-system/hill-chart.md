## Key Milestones

1. ✅ **End of Week 1**: Basic CLI working, can list and show principles
2. ✅ **End of Week 2**: Can select principles, ALL principles documented (exceeded target!)
3. **End of Week 3**: Agent integration started
4. **End of Week 4**: Agents principle-aware, CLAUDE.md integration
5. **End of Week 5**: Full documentation, learn command integration
6. **End of Week 6**: Ship ready, all tests passing

## Risks and Mitigations

### 🟡 Medium Risk: Principle Content Quality

- **Risk**: Principles might be too vague or too prescriptive
- **Mitigation**: Review each principle with test users early
- **Indicator**: Difficulty writing clear guidance

### 🟡 Medium Risk: Agent Integration Complexity

- **Risk**: Making agents principle-aware might be complex
- **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on testing
- **Indicator**: Agents giving conflicting or confusing guidance

### 🟢 Low Risk: Technical Implementation

- **Risk**: CLI or data structure issues
- **Mitigation**: Following established patterns
- **Indicator**: Any deviation from existing command structure

## Notes

- This hill chart will be updated weekly during building phase
- Dots will move right as unknowns are resolved and work progresses
- Color coding: 🔴 High confidence, 🟡 Medium confidence, 🟢 Resolved
