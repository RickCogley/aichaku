## Scopes and Their Position

### 1. CLI Implementation ✅

**Position**: Done - shipped **Status**: Complete **Confidence**: High - fully working

Completed work:

- All subcommands implemented (list, show, search, category)
- Proper error handling and validation
- Branded output with 🌸 emoji
- ConfigManager integration
- Help documentation complete

No remaining work - ready for use

### 2. Data Structure & Storage ✅

**Position**: Done - shipped **Status**: Complete **Confidence**: High - fully working

Completed work:

- Complete TypeScript interfaces (Principle, PrincipleWithDocs)
- PrincipleLoader with caching and validation
- YAML + Markdown dual-file support
- Path security integration
- Search and category filtering

No remaining work - ready for use

### 3. Principle Content Creation ✅

**Position**: Done - shipped **Status**: Complete **Confidence**: High - all principles created

Completed work:

- All 18 principles written with comprehensive documentation
- Consistent YAML + Markdown structure across all principles
- Rich practical examples and code samples
- Balanced guidance that's helpful but not prescriptive
- Historical context and compatibility information

No remaining work - content is comprehensive and ready

### 4. Agent Integration 🟡

**Position**: Starting - base of hill **Status**: Not started **Confidence**: Medium - needs experimentation

Key unknowns:

- Best way to inject principle context
- How to make guidance non-intrusive
- Balancing multiple principles

Remaining work:

- Update orchestrator
- Modify specialist agents
- Test guidance quality

### 5. Documentation & Templates 🔴

**Position**: Starting - base of hill **Status**: Not started **Confidence**: High - straightforward

Key unknowns resolved:

- Documentation structure clear
- Template needs identified

Remaining work:

- Write all guides
- Update existing docs
- Create templates

### 6. Testing & Polish 🔴

**Position**: Starting - base of hill **Status**: Not started **Confidence**: High - standard process

Key unknowns resolved:

- Testing approach clear
- Performance requirements understood

Remaining work:

- Write comprehensive tests
- Performance optimization
- Final polish

## Key Milestones

1. ✅ **End of Week 1**: Basic CLI working, can list and show principles
2. ✅ **End of Week 2**: Can select principles, ALL principles documented (exceeded target!)
3. **End of Week 3**: Agent integration started
4. **End of Week 4**: Agents principle-aware, CLAUDE.md integration
5. **End of Week 5**: Full documentation, learn command integration
6. **End of Week 6**: Ship ready, all tests passing

## Risks and Mitigations

### 🟡 Medium Risk: Principle Content Quality

- **Risk**: Principles might be too vague or too prescriptive
- **Mitigation**: Review each principle with test users early
- **Indicator**: Difficulty writing clear guidance

### 🟡 Medium Risk: Agent Integration Complexity

- **Risk**: Making agents principle-aware might be complex
- **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on testing
- **Indicator**: Agents giving conflicting or confusing guidance

### 🟢 Low Risk: Technical Implementation

- **Risk**: CLI or data structure issues
- **Mitigation**: Following established patterns
- **Indicator**: Any deviation from existing command structure

## Notes

- This hill chart will be updated weekly during building phase
- Dots will move right as unknowns are resolved and work progresses
- Color coding: 🔴 High confidence, 🟡 Medium confidence, 🟢 Resolved
