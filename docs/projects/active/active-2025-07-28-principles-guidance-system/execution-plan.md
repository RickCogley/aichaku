## Dependencies

- Requires yaml parsing library (already in project)
- May need interactive prompt library for selection
- Should coordinate with any ongoing agent updates

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Scope creep**: Stick to defined principles list, defer additions
2. **Agent complexity**: Start with simple guidance, iterate based on feedback
3. **Performance**: Implement caching early, test with realistic data
4. **User confusion**: Clear documentation and examples throughout

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All CLI commands work as specified
- [ ] At least 15 principles documented and available
- [ ] Agents provide helpful, non-intrusive guidance
- [ ] Users can easily understand and select principles
- [ ] Performance remains fast with many principles
- [ ] Tests provide good coverage
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive
