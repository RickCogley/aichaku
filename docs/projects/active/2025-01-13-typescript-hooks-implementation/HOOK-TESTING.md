# Hook Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document is created to test the docs-review hook that should trigger when markdown files are edited.

## Test Scenarios

1. **Documentation Standards Review**: The hook should check this markdown file against documentation standards
2. **JSDoc Checker**: When we edit TypeScript files, the jsdoc-checker should provide guidance

## Expected Behavior

When this file is created, we expect:
- The docs-review hook to analyze the markdown structure
- Suggestions for improvements if needed
- Validation of markdown formatting

## Notes

This is a test document to verify our hook system is working correctly.
