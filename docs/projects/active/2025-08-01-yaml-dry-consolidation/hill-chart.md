## Progress Indicators

### 🥾 At Base - Just Starting

- Understanding the problem
- Gathering requirements
- High uncertainty

### 🧗 Climbing - Figuring It Out

- Working through unknowns
- Making key decisions
- Building understanding

### 🏃 At Peak - Clarity Achieved

- Solution is clear
- Just need to execute
- Confidence is high

### 🚶 Descending - Delivering Value

- Implementation underway
- Seeing results
- Complexity decreasing

### ✅ Complete - Shipped

- Feature delivered
- Tests passing
- Documentation done

## Key Milestones

1. **metadata.yaml Removed** - User-visible fix complete
2. **Methodologies Loading** - All content types use YAML
3. **Unified Interface Ready** - Single source of truth created
4. **Migration Complete** - 70% code reduction achieved

## Risk Areas

- **Unified Interface Design** - Needs to support all content types
- **Backward Compatibility** - Must not break existing commands
- **Performance** - Caching strategy critical for speed

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies
- Can proceed independently on each task
- Migration depends on unified interface completion
