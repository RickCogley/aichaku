# MCP Auto-Integration Plan - Summary

## The Problem We're Solving

When users ask Claude Code to "generate comprehensive project documentation,"
the MCP server tools aren't being used automatically. This results in:

- Documentation without standards compliance

- No automatic quality checks

- Manual follow-up required

## Root Cause

The MCP server currently only has tools for **reviewing** existing content, not
**generating** new documentation. Additionally, tool descriptions lack the
keywords and patterns that would trigger automatic usage.

## Our Solution

### 1. Add Documentation Generation Tools

Create new MCP tools that align with user requests:

- `generate_documentation` - Creates comprehensive docs in /docs

- `analyze_project` - Understands project structure

- `create_doc_template` - Generates standard-compliant templates

### 2. Enhanced Tool Descriptions

Transform descriptions from technical to action-oriented:

````text
Before: "Review a file for security, standards, and methodology compliance"

After: "Automatically review code files for security vulnerabilities...
Keywords: review, audit, security, check, scan...
Auto-runs: After file edits, before commits..."
```text

### 3. Automatic Tool Chaining

Enable complex workflows that chain multiple tools:

```text
User: "Generate comprehensive documentation"
System: get*standards → analyze*project → generate*documentation → review*file
```text

### 4. Natural Language Triggers

Map common user phrases to appropriate tools:

- "generate docs" → `generate_documentation`

- "is this secure" → `review_file`

- "what standards" → `get_standards`

## Key Innovations

### Auto-Invocation Rules

Tools automatically trigger based on:

- User message patterns

- Recent file edits

- Project context

- Security-sensitive files

### Enhanced Metadata

Each tool includes:

- Keywords and aliases

- Trigger phrases

- Example prompts

- Auto-chain relationships

### Context Awareness

The system detects:

- When you edit auth/security files

- When you mention methodologies

- When you're starting documentation

- When security concerns arise

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Documentation generation tools **Day 2**: Enhanced discovery system
**Day 3**: Auto-invocation engine **Day 4**: Integration and testing

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Zero-Touch Documentation**: One request generates complete, compliant docs

2. **Automatic Reviews**: Every generated file is automatically checked

3. **Natural Interactions**: Tools respond to how users naturally ask

4. **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent automatic tool usage

## Success Metrics

- 90%+ of documentation requests use MCP tools automatically

- No manual "review this with MCP" follow-ups needed

- Generated docs comply with selected standards

- Users report smoother workflow

## Next Steps

With this plan shaped, we're ready to implement:

1. New documentation generation capabilities

2. Enhanced tool descriptions and metadata

3. Automatic invocation engine

4. Natural language mapping

This will transform the MCP server from a passive reviewer to an active
participant in the development workflow.
