# Aichaku Feedback Hook Implementation - Completion Report

## Summary

Successfully implemented the `aichaku-feedback` hook to provide visual confirmation that the Aichaku hook system is active and working.

## What Was Done

### 1. Updated Hook Runner (`aichaku-hooks.ts`)
- Added new `aichakuFeedback` function that provides context-aware feedback
- Integrated it into the switch statement for hook execution
- Uses `console.error()` to ensure messages appear in Claude Code
- Always exits with code 0 to avoid blocking operations

### 2. Updated Hooks Command (`src/commands/hooks.ts`)
- Added `aichaku-feedback` to the HOOK_TEMPLATES
- Included it in the "essential" hooks category (first position)
- Configured as PreToolUse hook with `.*` matcher (runs for all tools)

### 3. Created Documentation
- Created `/docs/hooks/aichaku-feedback.md` with detailed usage instructions
- Documented both CLI and manual installation methods
- Included troubleshooting guide

### 4. Built and Installed
- Ran `deno fmt` to fix formatting
- Built the project with `deno task build`
- Installed the hook: `./dist/aichaku-0.28.0-macos-arm64 hooks --install aichaku-feedback --global`

## Key Features Implemented

### Visual Feedback Messages

**For Files:**
- `🪴 Aichaku: Monitoring [filename]`
- `📁 Project file - will track progress` (project files)
- `📖 Markdown - will review standards` (markdown files)
- `📚 Code - will check JSDoc` (TypeScript/JavaScript)
- `🔒 Code - will check security` (other languages)
- `⚙️ Workflow - will validate actions` (GitHub Actions)
- `🧪 Test file - will check coverage` (test files)
- `🔐 Config - extra security checks` (.env/config files)

**For Commands:**
- `📝 Will check conventional format` (git commit)
- `🚀 Will track CI/CD workflows` (git push)
- `🔍 Will check security advisories` (npm install/yarn add)
- `🧪 Will track test results` (test commands)

**Generic:**
- `🪴 Aichaku: Hook system active ✓`

## Technical Implementation

The hook:
1. Reads the tool input from stdin (file path, command, etc.)
2. Determines the context (file type or command type)
3. Displays appropriate brief feedback via console.error()
4. Exits with code 0 to continue normal operation

## Installation Status

✅ Hook is now installed globally and will be active after Claude Code restart.

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Claude Code** to activate the hook
2. Try editing different file types to see the feedback
3. The feedback will appear briefly when you use any tool

## Benefits

- **Immediate confirmation** that hooks are working
- **Context-aware messages** based on what you're doing
- **Non-intrusive** - just enough info without cluttering
- **Always safe** - exits with 0 to never block operations

The "yes, the system is working" feedback is now in place!
