# Status: Git Hooks Detection Improvement

üçÉ **Phase**: Complete\
**Started**: 2025-08-08\
**Completed**: 2025-08-08\
**Type**: Bug Fix / Enhancement

## Progress

### Completed

- [x] Identified the issue: hardcoded `.aichaku-githooks` directory assumption
- [x] Added dynamic detection via `git config --get core.hooksPath`
- [x] Updated `isInstalled()` to check actual configured path
- [x] Fixed conflict detection to recognize valid installations
- [x] Updated `setGitHooksPath()` to preserve user's directory choice

### Completed

- [x] Testing the changes with actual `aichaku githooks` command
- [x] Fixed display to show actual configured hooks directory
- [x] Test with existing `.githooks` directory - Works perfectly!
- [x] All hooks execute successfully with --test
- [x] Improved UI to differentiate Aichaku vs external hooks
- [x] Documentation of test results

### Ready for Release

All fixes have been tested and verified working:

- `aichaku githooks` - Shows correct status
- `aichaku githooks --list` - Lists hooks with proper formatting
- `aichaku githooks --test` - Successfully runs all enabled hooks

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add --sync command to update from templates
- [ ] Add --hooks-dir flag for custom directory on install
- [ ] Test with fresh installation

## Technical Details

The main issue was in `src/utils/githook-manager.ts`:

- Constructor assumed `.aichaku-githooks`
- `isInstalled()` only checked for that specific directory
- Conflict detection treated any other directory as a conflict

Now the manager:

1. Checks actual git config for `core.hooksPath`
2. Uses whatever directory is configured
3. Only reports conflicts for truly conflicting setups

## Testing Notes

User reported: After running `aichaku upgrade`, the command shows "‚ùå Git hooks are not installed" even though:

- Git config shows `core.hooksPath = .githooks`
- The `.githooks` directory exists with hooks
- Everything is properly configured

With our fix, it should now recognize this as a valid installation.
