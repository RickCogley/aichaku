# Key Improvements for Aichaku v0.5.1

## 📍 Current Status

Currently in Planning Mode, working on fixing Aichaku integration behavior.

## ✅ What We've Addressed

### 1. **Specific File Paths Everywhere**

- Every "read" instruction now has exact paths

- Example: "Read `~/.claude/methodologies/common/PLANNING-MODE.md`"

- No guesswork required

### 2. **Automatic Document Creation**

- Claude Code will create documents without asking

- Right templates for right methodology

- Always in `.claude/output/active-*/`

### 3. **Never Proceed Without Approval**

- Planning documents created automatically

- Execution waits for human "yes"

- Clear stopping points

### 4. **Status Management**

- Folders renamed: active- → complete-/cancelled-/paused-

- CHANGE-LOG.md created on completion

- Clear lifecycle tracking

### 5. **Continuous Progress Updates**

- STATUS.md updated after each action

- Responses start with "📍 Currently in [mode]..."

- User always knows where we are

### 6. **Git Automation**

- Automatic add, commit, push when complete

- Conventional commit messages

- Option to split large commits

### 7. **Document Creation Freedom**

- Never asks "can I create...?"

- Just creates what's needed

- Organizes with subdirectories

## 🎯 The Magic Formula

**Before**: "Let's shape a feature" → Confusion → Wrong location → Manual fixes

**After**: "Let's shape a feature" →

1. Creates `.claude/output/active-2025-01-07-feature-name/`

2. Reads `~/.claude/methodologies/shape-up/SHAPE-UP-AICHAKU-GUIDE.md`

3. Creates pitch.md from template

4. Updates STATUS.md

5. Waits for approval

## 📋 Planning Complete. Ready to Proceed?

The comprehensive solution is designed. Implementation will take ~2 hours for
v0.5.1.
