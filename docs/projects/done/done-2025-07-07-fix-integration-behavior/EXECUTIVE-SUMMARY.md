# Executive Summary: Making Aichaku Truly Magical

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of behavioral psychology in software design
- Knowledge of LLM instruction design
- Familiarity with CLI tool development
- Experience with automated workflows

## Overview

This executive summary outlines the transformation strategy for Aichaku.

## The Vision

Transform Aichaku from a passive methodology library into an active behavioral
modification system that makes Claude Code automatically follow best practices
without user intervention.

## Core Problem

Current Aichaku (v0.5.0) provides documentation but doesn't change behavior:

- Claude Code ignores methodology keywords
- Documents created in wrong locations
- You must manually enforce conventions
- No automatic corrections or guidance

## The Solution: 5-Layer Behavioral System

### 1. **Imperative Instructions** (Not Suggestions)

- Replace "This project uses..." with "YOU MUST..."
- Use commanding language that LLMs follow
- Repeat critical rules multiple times
- Visual indicators (‚úÖ ‚ùå) for clarity

### 2. **Pre-Created Structure** (Guide Rails)

```text
.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AICHAKU-RULES.md         # Behavioral enforcement
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .aichaku-active          # Current project tracker
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Location rules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ active-example/     # Shows correct usage
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ done-example/       # Shows completion
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/                  # Auto-correction scripts
```

### 3. **Natural Language Triggers** (Just Works‚Ñ¢)

- "shape up X" ‚Üí Creates pitch in correct location
- "sprint planning" ‚Üí Creates sprint docs automatically
- "we're done" ‚Üí Moves to done-\*/ with retrospective
- No configuration or questions

### 4. **Self-Correcting Behaviors** (Auto-Magic)

- Wrong location? Automatically moved
- Missing STATUS.md? Created instantly
- Forgot to commit? Done for you
- Project complete? Transitioned automatically

### 5. **Multiple Reinforcement Points** (Can't Miss)

- CLAUDE.md - Primary directives
- AICHAKU-RULES.md - Before each action
- output/README.md - Location reminder
- Git hooks - Catch mistakes
- Error messages - Guide to correct behavior

## Immediate Actions (v0.5.1 - 2 hours)

### 1. Rewrite CLAUDE.md Integration Section

```markdown
## üéØ MANDATORY: Aichaku Integration Rules

YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES WITHOUT EXCEPTION:

1. ‚úÖ Create ALL documents in .claude/output/active-\*/
2. ‚ùå NEVER create documents elsewhere
3. ‚úÖ Create STATUS.md FIRST for every project
4. ‚úÖ Update STATUS.md after EVERY session
5. ‚úÖ Git commit after changes

When user says ‚Üí You MUST create:

- "shape" ‚Üí pitch.md
- "sprint" ‚Üí sprint-plan.md
- "done" ‚Üí retrospective.md + move to done-\*/
```

### 2. Update Init Command

```typescript
// Add to cli/commands/init.ts
- Create .claude/AICHAKU-RULES.md
- Create .claude/output/ structure
- Create .claude/.aichaku-active tracker
- Add example projects
- Show magical welcome message
```

### 3. Add Behavioral Files

- AICHAKU-RULES.md - Critical reminders
- output/README.md - Location guide
- output/WHERE-FILES-GO.md - Visual examples
- hooks/pre-create-file.sh - Path validator

## Next Phase (v0.6.0 - 1 week)

### 1. Natural Language Detection

- Intent detection from user input
- Automatic methodology selection
- Smart project naming
- Context-aware responses

### 2. Auto-Correction System

- File system monitor
- Automatic path correction
- Git integration for fixes
- Status auto-updater

### 3. Enhanced Git Hooks

- Pre-commit location checker
- Automatic file movement
- Commit message enhancement
- Status update enforcement

## Success Metrics

### Immediate (After v0.5.1)

‚úÖ You report "it just works" ‚úÖ No manual directory creation ‚úÖ Documents
always in correct location ‚úÖ Natural language triggers work

### Long-term (After v0.6.0)

‚úÖ Zero incorrect file placements ‚úÖ Automatic status tracking ‚úÖ Seamless
project transitions ‚úÖ Delightful "magical" experience

## The Magic Formula

```text
Imperative Instructions +
Pre-Created Structure +
Natural Language Detection +
Self-Correcting Behaviors +
Multiple Reinforcements
=
Truly Magical Developer Experience
```

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with imperative rules
- [ ] Modify init command to create structure
- [ ] Add behavioral reinforcement files
- [ ] Create example projects
- [ ] Add .aichaku-active tracker
- [ ] Implement basic path validation
- [ ] Test with fresh install
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Release v0.5.1

## Expected User Experience

### Before (Current v0.5.0)

```text
User: "Let's shape up a search feature"
Claude: "I'll help you with that" *creates file in project root*
User: "No, it should go in .claude/output/..."
Claude: "Let me move that..."
```

### After (Magical v0.5.1)

```text
User: "Let's shape up a search feature"
Claude: *automatically creates .claude/output/active-2025-01-07-search-feature/pitch.md*
Claude: "Created Shape Up pitch in the correct location. STATUS.md updated."
User: "Wow, it just worked!"
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Over-correction**: Only move obvious project documents
2. **User Confusion**: Clear welcome message explains the magic
3. **Git Conflicts**: Use `|| true` for non-critical git operations
4. **Performance**: Lightweight file monitoring, no heavy processes

## Conclusion

By applying behavioral psychology principles and learning from successful
automation tools, we can transform Aichaku from a passive library into an active
assistant that makes methodology adoption truly effortless. The key is multiple
layers of reinforcement that guide Claude Code to do the right thing
automatically, every time.
