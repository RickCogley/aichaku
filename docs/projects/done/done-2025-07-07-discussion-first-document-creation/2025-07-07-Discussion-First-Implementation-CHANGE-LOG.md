# 2025-07-07 Discussion-First Implementation - Change Log

## Summary

Transformed Aichaku from immediate document creation to a thoughtful
discussion-first approach.

## Changes Made

### 1. Rewrote Section 1: Document Creation Behavior

- Added three-phase approach:
  - Phase 1: Discussion Mode (default)
  - Phase 2: Wait for Explicit Readiness
  - Phase 3: Create Named Project
- Prevents premature folder creation
- Ensures projects are well-defined before documentation

### 2. Updated Section 2: No Asking Rule

- Split into two contexts:
  - During Discussion: Encourage exploration
  - After Readiness: Create immediately
- Maintains "no asking" principle once user is ready

### 3. Modified Section 3: Methodology Detection

- Changed from "IMMEDIATELY create" to "ENTER DISCUSSION MODE"
- Keywords now trigger discussion, not instant creation
- Documents created only after explicit signal

## Example Flow

```
User: "I want to shape a new feature"
ðŸª´ Aichaku: I see you're interested in Shape Up. What problem are you looking to solve?
[Discussion continues...]
User: "Let's create a project for this"
ðŸª´ Aichaku: Creating project: payment-redesign
```

## Impact

- No more cluttered output with unnamed folders
- Projects have meaningful names from the start
- Better user experience with natural workflow
- Respects user autonomy while providing structure

## Status

âœ… Implementation complete âœ… Tests passing âœ… Ready for release
