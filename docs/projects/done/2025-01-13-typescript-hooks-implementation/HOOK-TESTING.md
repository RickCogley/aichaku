# Hook Testing Documentation

## Overview

This document is created to test the docs-review hook that should trigger when
Markdown files are edited.

## Test Scenarios

1. **Documentation Standards Review**: The hook should check this Markdown file
   against documentation standards

2. **JSDoc Checker**: When we edit TypeScript files, the jsdoc-checker should
   provide guidance

## Expected Behavior

When this file is created, we expect:

- The docs-review hook to analyze the Markdown structure

- Suggestions for improvements if needed

- Validation of Markdown formatting

## Notes

This is a test document to verify our hook system is working correctly.
