# Creative GitHub MCP + Hooks Integration Ideas

## Overview

These hooks demonstrate creative ways to integrate GitHub functionality into
your Claude Code workflow using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). When combined
with a GitHub MCP server, these hooks can trigger automated GitHub actions based
on your coding activities.

## Implemented Hook Ideas

### 1. TODO Tracker (`todo-tracker`)

**Trigger**: PostToolUse on Write/Edit **Purpose**: Detect when TODOs are added
to code and suggest creating GitHub issues

**Features**:

- Monitors code and Markdown files for TODO additions
- Suggests creating GitHub issues with proper formatting
- Supports linking TODOs to existing issues (e.g., `TODO(#123)`)
- Encourages labeling (e.g., `TODO(security)`) and prioritization

**MCP Integration**: Could automatically create draft issues from TODOs with
AI-generated descriptions.

### 2. PR Context Checker (`pr-checker`)

**Trigger**: SessionStart **Purpose**: Check active PR status when starting a
Claude session

**Features**:

- Reminds you of active pull requests
- Suggests checking CI status before making changes
- Encourages updating PR descriptions as work progresses
- Links commits to the active PR

**MCP Integration**: Could fetch and display current PR status, CI results, and
review comments.

### 3. Issue Linker (`issue-linker`)

**Trigger**: PreToolUse on Bash (git commit) **Purpose**: Remind developers to
link commits to GitHub issues

**Features**:

- Detects git commit commands
- Shows proper issue linking syntax (Fixes #123, Closes #123)
- Supports multiple issue references
- Explains the difference between closing and referencing

**MCP Integration**: Could suggest relevant open issues based on the files being
changed.

### 4. Workflow Monitor (`workflow-monitor`)

**Trigger**: PostToolUse on Write/Edit (.GitHub/workflows/) **Purpose**: Provide
guidance when modifying GitHub Actions workflows

**Features**:

- Detects changes to workflow files
- Suggests testing locally with `act`
- Reminds about security best practices
- Shows commands to check workflow status

**MCP Integration**: Could validate workflow syntax and check for security
issues.

### 5. Release Helper (`release-helper`)

**Trigger**: PostToolUse on Write/Edit (version files) **Purpose**: Guide
through release process when version bumps are detected

**Features**:

- Detects version changes in package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.
- Provides release checklist
- Explains semantic versioning
- Shows release creation commands

**MCP Integration**: Could auto-generate release notes from commit history and
create draft releases.

## Additional Creative Ideas

### 6. Code Owner Notifier

**Purpose**: Check CODEOWNERS file and notify about required reviews

```typescript
// When editing files, check who owns them
// Suggest adding them as PR reviewers
// Show their GitHub status (available/busy)
```

### 7. Security Advisory Checker

**Purpose**: Check for security advisories when updating dependencies

```typescript
// On package.json changes, check GitHub Advisory Database
// Show CVEs for dependencies
// Suggest safer alternatives
```

### 8. Branch Protection Reminder

**Purpose**: Warn before operations that might fail due to branch protection

```typescript
// Before force pushes or direct main commits
// Check branch protection rules
// Suggest proper workflow (PR instead of direct push)
```

### 9. Issue Template Filler

**Purpose**: Help fill out issue templates correctly

```typescript
// When creating issues, parse .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE
// Guide through required fields
// Validate against template requirements
```

### 10. PR Size Monitor

**Purpose**: Warn when changes are getting too large

```typescript
// Track lines changed in session
// Suggest splitting into smaller PRs
// Show best practices for PR size
```

## Installation Examples

To add these GitHub hooks to your Claude settings:

```bash
# Add individual hook
aichaku hooks --install todo-tracker --global

# Or add as a set
aichaku hooks --install github-integration --global
```

## Hook Configuration

Add to your settings.json:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "deno run --allow-read --allow-write ~/.claude/aichaku/hooks/aichaku-hooks.ts todo-tracker"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "deno run --allow-read --allow-write ~/.claude/aichaku/hooks/aichaku-hooks.ts pr-checker"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## MCP Server Integration

These hooks work best when paired with a GitHub MCP server that can:

1. **Read Operations**:
   - Fetch issue lists
   - Get PR status
   - Check workflow runs
   - Read CODEOWNERS

2. **Write Operations**:
   - Create issues from TODOs
   - Update PR descriptions
   - Add comments
   - Create releases

3. **Smart Features**:
   - AI-powered issue descriptions
   - Automatic PR categorization
   - Smart issue assignment
   - Release note generation

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Context Switching**: Stay in Claude Code while managing GitHub
2. **Automated Workflows**: Let hooks handle repetitive GitHub tasks
3. **Better Practices**: Gentle reminders for GitHub best practices
4. **AI Enhancement**: Use Claude's intelligence for GitHub operations

## Security Considerations

- Hooks only provide suggestions and reminders
- Actual GitHub operations require explicit MCP server calls
- No credentials are stored in hooks
- All GitHub operations use secure MCP channels

## Future Possibilities

- **Git History Analysis**: Suggest code owners based on git blame
- **Smart PR Reviews**: Auto-request reviews from relevant contributors
- **Issue Prediction**: Suggest creating issues before problems arise
- **Workflow Optimization**: Analyze and suggest workflow improvements
- **Team Notifications**: Notify team members through GitHub when appropriate

The combination of Aichaku hooks and GitHub MCP creates a powerful development
environment where GitHub operations are seamlessly integrated into your coding
workflow!
