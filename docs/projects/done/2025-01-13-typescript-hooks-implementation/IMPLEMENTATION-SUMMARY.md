# TypeScript Hooks Implementation Summary

## Overview

Updated the Aichaku hooks system to generate hooks with the correct nested
structure that Claude Code expects, and migrated from bash-based hooks to a
unified TypeScript runner for better security and cross-platform compatibility.

## Key Changes

### 1. Hook Structure Update

Changed from flat format to nested format with matcher and hooks array:

**Before:**

```json
{
  "name": "Aichaku Path Validator",
  "matcher": "Write|MultiEdit",
  "command": "bash -c '...'"
}
```

**After:**

```json
{
  "matcher": "Write|MultiEdit",
  "hooks": [
    {
      "type": "command",
      "command": "deno run --allow-read --allow-write ~/.claude/aichaku/hooks/aichaku-hooks.ts path-validator"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. TypeScript Hook Runner

Created a unified TypeScript runner (`aichaku-hooks.ts`) that:

- Handles all hook types with proper TypeScript support
- Reads input from stdin and environment variables
- Implements all hook logic in a single, maintainable file
- Provides better error handling and cross-platform compatibility

### 3. Updated Hook Templates

All hook templates now use the TypeScript runner:

```typescript
command: `deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-env ~/.claude/aichaku/hooks/aichaku-hooks.ts hook-name`;
```

### 4. Type Definitions

Added proper TypeScript types to `types.ts`:

- `HookConfig` - Claude Code hook configuration
- `ClaudeSettings` - Settings structure with hooks
- `HookTemplate` - Hook template definition

### 5. Installation Logic Updates

- Updated `installHooks` to create the correct nested structure
- Fixed conversation-summary hooks to use the same format
- Renamed `ensureConversationSummaryScript` to `ensureHookScripts`
- Script is now installed for all hooks, not just conversation-summary

### 6. Display and Validation Updates

- Updated `displayHooksFromSettings` to handle nested structure
- Fixed `validateHooks` to check the new format
- Extract hook names from commands for better display

## Benefits

1. **Correct Format**: Hooks now match Claude Code's expected structure
2. **Better Security**: TypeScript runner with proper input validation
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on all platforms Deno supports
4. **Maintainability**: Single TypeScript file for all hook logic
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type checking

## Testing

All TypeScript files compile successfully:

```bash
deno check **/*.ts  # ✅ Success
```

## Recent Additions

### GitHub Integration Hooks

Created 5 new GitHub-focused hooks:

- **todo-tracker**: Scans for TODOs and suggests GitHub issues
- **pr-checker**: Validates PR readiness before commits
- **issue-linker**: Links commits to GitHub issues
- **workflow-monitor**: Monitors GitHub Actions status
- **release-helper**: Assists with release preparation

### Documentation Review Hooks

- **docs-review**: Reviews markdown files against documentation standards
- **jsdoc-checker**: Adaptive JSDoc validation that detects project type
  (Deno/TSDoc/JSDoc/TypeDoc)

### Hook Distribution Discovery

- Found that hooks are NOT automatically installed during `aichaku init`
- Proposed binary distribution model similar to MCP servers
- Created comprehensive documentation for the new approach

## Dogfooding Results

Successfully installed and tested hooks globally:

- path-validator ✅
- status-updater ✅
- commit-validator ✅
- conversation-summary ✅
- docs-review ✅
- jsdoc-checker ✅

Key insight: Selective installation is crucial to avoid noise from hooks
triggering too frequently.

## Next Steps

1. Compile TypeScript hooks to binary for v0.29.0 release
2. Consider sub-argument support for JSDoc flavor specification
3. Integrate hook installation with `aichaku init` command
4. Create migration guide for users transitioning to new hook system
