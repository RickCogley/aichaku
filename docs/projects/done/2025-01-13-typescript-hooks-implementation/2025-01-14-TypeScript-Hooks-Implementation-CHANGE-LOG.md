# TypeScript Hooks Implementation Change Log

## Date: 2025-01-14

## Summary

Implemented a comprehensive TypeScript-based hooks system for Aichaku, replacing the previous bash-based approach. This
provides better performance, type safety, and a unified codebase for all hook functionality.

## Major Changes

### 1. Unified TypeScript Hook Runner

- Created `/Users/rcogley/.claude/aichaku/hooks/aichaku-hooks.ts`
- Single TypeScript file with switch-based routing for all hooks
- Replaced individual bash scripts with TypeScript implementations
- Better error handling and consistent behavior

### 2. New Hook Categories

Added categorized hooks for easier installation:

- **Essential** (4 hooks): Core Claude+Aichaku workflow hooks
- **Productivity** (4 hooks): Workflow enhancement hooks
- **Security** (2 hooks): Compliance and safety checks
- **GitHub** (5 hooks): GitHub integration and automation

### 3. New GitHub Integration Hooks

- `todo-tracker`: Scans code for TODOs and suggests GitHub issues
- `pr-checker`: Validates PR readiness before submission
- `issue-linker`: Links commits to GitHub issues
- `workflow-monitor`: Monitors GitHub Actions status
- `release-helper`: Assists with semantic versioning and releases

### 4. Documentation Review Hooks

- `docs-review`: Reviews Markdown files against documentation standards
- `jsdoc-checker`: Validates JSDoc comments with project-aware style detection (Deno, TSDoc, JSDoc, TypeDoc)

### 5. Enhanced Hooks Command

Updated `aichaku hooks` command with:

- Category-based installation (`--install essential`)
- Local/global scope options
- Validation functionality
- Improved list display with categories

### 6. Comprehensive JSDoc Documentation

Added detailed JSDoc comments to all public APIs:

- Command functions with examples
- Type definitions with descriptions
- Module-level documentation
- Return type specifications

## Technical Improvements

### Performance

- Decided against binary compilation after analysis showed minimal benefit (~2-3 seconds per session)
- TypeScript execution via Deno is fast enough for hook use cases
- Simpler distribution without compilation complexity

### Type Safety

- Fixed all TypeScript type errors
- Replaced `any` types with proper typing
- Added comprehensive type definitions for hook interfaces

### Code Organization

- Moved test files to `/scratch` directory
- Cleaned up project root
- Better separation of concerns

## Files Changed

### Created

- `/Users/rcogley/.claude/aichaku/hooks/aichaku-hooks.ts` - Main hook implementation
- Multiple documentation files in `docs/projects/active/2025-01-13-typescript-hooks-implementation/`
- Test files moved to `/scratch/`

### Modified

- `src/commands/hooks.ts` - Added categories and new hooks
- `src/types.ts` - Fixed type definitions
- `README.md` - Added hooks and standards documentation
- `docs/README.md` - Updated with v0.29.0 features
- All command files - Added comprehensive JSDoc

## Breaking Changes

None - the new hook system is backward compatible with existing configurations.

## Migration Notes

- Users can install the new hooks using `aichaku hooks --install [category]`
- Existing hooks continue to work
- The TypeScript hook runner must be manually copied to `~/.claude/aichaku/hooks/` until next release

## Next Steps

1. Release v0.29.0 with these changes
2. Update installation process to include TypeScript hooks
3. Consider adding more hook categories based on user feedback
4. Potentially add hook marketplace for community contributions
