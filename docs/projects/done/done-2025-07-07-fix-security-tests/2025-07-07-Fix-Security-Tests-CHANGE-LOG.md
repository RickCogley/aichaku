# Fix Security Tests - Change Log

**Date**: 2025-07-07

## Summary

Fixed failing Security Tests GitHub Action by formatting CLAUDE.md to meet Deno formatter requirements.

## Problem

The Security Tests workflow was failing on every commit with formatting errors in CLAUDE.md. The integration content
added by `aichaku integrate` had line breaks that didn't meet the formatter's expectations.

## Solution

Ran `deno fmt CLAUDE.md` to automatically fix all formatting issues.

## Changes Made

- Formatted CLAUDE.md to fix line breaks and whitespace
- No content changes, only formatting adjustments

## Impact

- Security Tests should now pass
- All GitHub Actions workflows should be green
- No functional changes to the code or documentation

## Technical Details

The formatter was complaining about:

- Lines being split incorrectly with trailing whitespace
- Inconsistent line breaks in the methodology section
- Multiple short lines that should be combined

The `deno fmt` command automatically fixed all these issues.
