# GitHub Pages Jekyll Liquid Syntax Fix

## Status

**Phase**: ✅ Complete **Dates**: 2025-07-28 **Outcome**: Successfully resolved GitHub Pages build failures

## Problem

GitHub Pages was failing to build with Liquid syntax errors:

```
Error: Liquid syntax error (line 10): Tag '{% %}' was not properly terminated
```

The issue occurred because:

1. GitHub Pages uses Jekyll by default when serving from repository root
2. Jekyll recursively processes all files linked from the README
3. Template files in `docs/` contained Liquid-like syntax (`{% raw %}`, `{% %}`)
4. These template files are meant to be copied to user installations unchanged

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Convert Relative Links to Absolute GitHub URLs

Changed all documentation links in README.md from relative to absolute:

- `[Documentation](docs/)` → `[Documentation](https://github.com/RickCogley/aichaku/tree/main/docs)`
- This prevents Jekyll from following and processing linked files

### 2. Add Jekyll Configuration

Created `_config.yml` to explicitly exclude problematic directories:

```yaml
exclude:
  - docs/
  - mcp/
  - scripts/
  # ... other directories
```

### 3. Document the Solution

Updated the Jekyll guide to explain:

- Why absolute URLs are the best solution
- How this enables Mermaid diagram rendering
- Benefits of letting users browse the repository directly

## Key Insights

1. **Mermaid Diagrams**: GitHub's native interface renders Mermaid diagrams, but GitHub Pages doesn't without complex
   Jekyll setup
2. **Better User Experience**: Browsing the repository provides full GitHub features
3. **Template Integrity**: Avoids modifying template files that users depend on
4. **Simple Solution**: Using absolute URLs is cleaner than complex Jekyll configurations

## Files Modified

- `README.md` - Converted all `/docs` links to absolute GitHub URLs
- `_config.yml` - Created to exclude directories from Jekyll processing
- `docs/reference/jekyll-github-rendering-guide.md` - Updated with clear solution documentation

## Outcome

✅ GitHub Pages now successfully builds and serves from: https://rickcogley.github.io/aichaku/ ✅ All documentation
remains accessible via GitHub's native interface ✅ Mermaid diagrams render properly when browsing the repository ✅
Template files remain unchanged for user installations
