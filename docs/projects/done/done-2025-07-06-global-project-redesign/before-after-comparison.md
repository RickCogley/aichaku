# Before vs After: Aichaku v0.5.0

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Before (v0.4.x)

```
project/
└── .claude/
    ├── methodologies/     # 50+ files copied here
    ├── user/             # Customizations
    └── .aichaku.json     # Metadata

Problem: Every project duplicates all methodology files
```

### After (v0.5.0)

```
~/.claude/                 # Global (one copy)
└── methodologies/         # All files here

project/
├── CLAUDE.md             # Just a reference
└── .claude/
    └── user/             # Only customizations
```

## 🧠 Natural Language

### Before:

Users need to remember to create folders:

```
You: "Let's add a new authentication feature"
Claude: "I'll help you add authentication. What type..."
*No automatic structure creation*
```

### After:

Automatic structure creation:

```
You: "Let's add a new authentication feature"
Claude: "I'll help you add authentication. I've created the project structure at:
📁 .claude/output/active-2025-07-06-authentication-feature/

Let me start by understanding your requirements..."
```

## 🌟 Overall Experience

### Before:

- ❌ Confusing global vs local

## Summary

v0.5.0 transforms Aichaku from a tool that works into a tool that delights.
Every interaction is thoughtful, every message is clear, and the entire
experience feels magical rather than mechanical.
