# 2025-07-11 Fix Security Workflow - Change Log

## Summary
Fixed DevSkim security alerts by replacing direct file system operations with validated security utilities.

## Changes

### Security Fixes
- **src/commands/integrate.ts**: Replaced `Deno.readTextFile` and `Deno.stat` with `safeReadTextFile` and `safeStat`
- **src/commands/docs-standard.ts**: Replaced `Deno.readTextFile` with `safeReadTextFile`
- **src/commands/hooks.ts**: Replaced `Deno.readTextFile` with `safeReadTextFile`
- **src/migration/folder-migration.ts**: Replaced `Deno.remove` with `safeRemove`
- **scripts/build-binaries.ts**: Replaced `Deno.readFile` with `safeReadFile`

### Technical Details
- All file operations now validate paths against their expected base directories
- Prevents directory traversal attacks (OWASP A01)
- Uses existing security utilities from `src/utils/path-security.ts`
- Fixed TypeScript type error by using proper home directory paths

## Testing
- All modified files pass TypeScript type checking
- Integration tests pass successfully
- Security validation is consistent across all file operations

## Impact
- Resolves all DevSkim alerts in the security workflow
- Improves security posture of the codebase
- No functional changes for end users
