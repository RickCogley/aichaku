# Security Scanning Enhancement - Project Status

## 🌱 Project Phase: Active Development

**Started**: 2025-08-02 **Cycle**: 6 weeks **Status**: Week 1 - Problem Investigation Complete

## Progress Overview

[Investigation] → [**Implementation**] → [Testing] → [Documentation] → [Deployment] ▲

Week 1/6 ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 17% 🌱

## Completed Work

### ✅ Problem Investigation (Day 1)

- Discovered security scanners ARE installed: DevSkim, Semgrep, CodeQL
- Found scanner-controller.ts implementation exists with all scanners
- Identified root cause: Two different MCP server implementations
- Confirmed scanners work when tested directly

### ✅ Root Cause Analysis

- Original implementation has working scanners
- New implementation lacks proper integration
- MCP tool interface uses new implementation
- Security findings get lost in the pipeline

### ✅ Initial Fixes

- Updated git hook with MCP integration and fallbacks
- Added GitLeaks and Trivy to scanner-controller (conditional)
- Created comprehensive documentation
- Built diagnostic tools for testing

## Current Focus

### 🔄 Reconciling MCP Implementations

- Need to determine which implementation to use
- Port working scanner logic if needed
- Fix dependency issues in package.json

## Upcoming Work

### 📋 Week 1-2: Fix Display Pipeline

- [ ] Choose primary MCP implementation
- [ ] Update review-engine integration
- [ ] Fix feedback formatting
- [ ] Add missing dependencies
- [ ] Test security finding display

### 📋 Week 3-4: Git Hook Enhancement

- [ ] Implement smart detection logic
- [ ] Add staged file scanning
- [ ] Create clear error messages
- [ ] Test fallback scenarios

### 📋 Week 5-6: Testing & Polish

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] CI/CD integration guide
- [ ] User documentation

## Blockers & Risks

### 🚧 Current Blocker

**Two MCP implementations** - Need to decide which to use before proceeding

### ⚠️ Risks Identified

1. Breaking existing MCP functionality
2. Performance impact on commits
3. Dependency conflicts

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Which MCP implementation to use?**
   - Original: Working scanners, older architecture
   - New: Cleaner architecture, missing integration

2. **Dependency management approach?**
   - Bundle scanner tools with MCP
   - Require separate installation
   - Hybrid approach with clear instructions

## Next Steps

1. Review both MCP implementations in detail
2. Make architectural decision
3. Implement chosen solution
4. Test with real security vulnerabilities

## Team Notes

- Scanner detection is already conditional (good!)
- Git hook fallback logic implemented
- Documentation framework in place
- Need to ensure backward compatibility
