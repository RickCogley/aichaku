# Folder Reorganization - Project Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive folder reorganization to move Aichaku
files from `~/.claude/` to `~/.claude/aichaku/`, providing better namespace
separation and organizational structure while maintaining full backward
compatibility.

## Key Achievements

### 1. New Hierarchical Structure

- Moved all Aichaku files under dedicated `~/.claude/aichaku/` namespace
- Created clear separation between system files and user customizations
- Established logical organization: `methodologies/`, `standards/`, `user/`,
  `output/`, and `config/`
- Improved project-level organization under `.claude/aichaku/`

### 2. Path Management Infrastructure

- Created centralized `paths.ts` module for type-safe path access
- Implemented `AichakuPaths` interface for consistent path usage
- Added security validation with `isPathSafe()` function
- Maintained legacy path support for smooth transition

### 3. Migration System

- Built comprehensive migration tool with `aichaku migrate` command
- Implemented safety features: dry-run mode, automatic backups, rollback
  capability
- Created idempotent operations to prevent data loss
- Added progress indicators and detailed logging

### 4. Backward Compatibility

- All commands check new paths first, then fall back to legacy paths
- No breaking changes for existing users
- Migration is optional but recommended
- Safe transition period with continued legacy support

### 5. Updated Core Components

- Modified 14 core files to use new path structure
- Updated MCP server with legacy fallback support
- Enhanced all commands with new path awareness
- Maintained seamless operation during transition

## Technical Benefits

- **Clear Namespace**: Eliminates conflicts with other `~/.claude/` tools
- **Better Organization**: Logical hierarchy under dedicated subdirectory
- **Easier Management**: Simple uninstall by removing single directory
- **Future-Proof**: Room for growth without cluttering parent directory
- **Professional Structure**: Follows best practices for CLI tool organization

## Security Enhancements

- Centralized path validation through single module
- Enhanced path traversal protection
- Secure migration with backup capabilities
- Complete audit trail of operations

## Impact

This reorganization transforms Aichaku from a tool that scattered files across
`~/.claude/` into a well-organized system under its own namespace. Users benefit
from:

- Cleaner file system organization
- Reduced chance of conflicts with other tools
- Better understanding of what files belong to Aichaku
- Easier backup and migration of Aichaku data
- Professional structure matching industry standards

## Migration Path

New users install directly to the new structure, while existing users can
migrate at their convenience:

```bash
# Check migration status
aichaku migrate --dry-run

# Perform migration with backup
aichaku migrate --global --backup
```

## Next Steps

- Release with new folder structure
- Communicate migration benefits to users
- Monitor adoption rates
- Plan legacy support removal for v2.0

This reorganization positions Aichaku as a professional, well-structured tool
ready for long-term growth and maintenance.
