# Week 6 Plan: Testing & Polish

## Overview

This is the final week of the Building phase. Our goal is to ensure the principles system is production-ready with
comprehensive testing, performance optimization, and polished documentation.

## Objectives

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensure all functionality works correctly
2. **Performance Optimization**: Quick loading and minimal memory usage
3. **Documentation Polish**: Complete user-facing documentation
4. **Bug Fixes**: Address any edge cases or issues
5. **Release Preparation**: Prepare for cool-down phase

## Task Breakdown

### Day 1-2: End-to-End Testing

- [ ] Test all CLI commands with all 18 principles
  - `aichaku principles list`
  - `aichaku principles show <id>`
  - `aichaku principles search <query>`
  - `aichaku principles category <category>`
- [ ] Test principle selection and storage
  - `aichaku principles --select`
  - Verify aichaku.json updates correctly
- [ ] Test integration with other commands
  - `aichaku integrate` includes selected principles
  - `aichaku learn` shows principle information
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases
  - Invalid principle IDs
  - Corrupted YAML files
  - Missing Markdown files
  - Permission issues

### Day 3: Agent Integration Verification

- [ ] Test principle coach agent responses
- [ ] Verify orchestrator routing for principle questions
- [ ] Test specialist agents with principle context
- [ ] Ensure guidance is helpful but not prescriptive

### Day 4: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Profile principle loading times
- [ ] Optimize caching in PrincipleLoader
- [ ] Minimize file I/O operations
- [ ] Test with large numbers of selected principles
- [ ] Memory usage analysis

### Day 5: Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Update main README.md with principles feature
- [ ] Create user guide: "Getting Started with Principles"
- [ ] Document principle selection best practices
- [ ] Add principles to feature highlights
- [ ] Update changelog for release

### Day 6: Final Review & Release Prep

- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Review all code changes
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Tag release candidate
- [ ] Prepare for cool-down phase

## Success Criteria

1. **All Tests Pass**: 100% of automated tests passing
2. **Performance**: Principle operations complete in <100ms
3. **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive user documentation
4. **User Experience**: Smooth, intuitive principle selection and usage
5. **Production Ready**: No known bugs or issues

## Testing Checklist

### CLI Testing

```bash
# List all principles
aichaku principles list

# Show specific principle
aichaku principles show dry
aichaku principles show unix-philosophy

# Search functionality
aichaku principles search "simple"
aichaku principles search "test"

# Category filtering
aichaku principles category software-development
aichaku principles category human-centered

# Selection
aichaku principles --select dry,kiss,yagni
aichaku principles --select unix-philosophy,accessibility-first

# Integration
aichaku integrate
# Verify principles appear in CLAUDE.md

# Learn command
aichaku learn --principles
aichaku learn --principle-category software-development
aichaku learn dry
aichaku learn accessibility-first
```

### Edge Case Testing

```bash
# Invalid IDs
aichaku principles show invalid-principle

# Multiple selections
aichaku principles --select dry --select kiss

# Empty selections
aichaku principles --select ""

# Very long searches
aichaku principles search "this is a very long search query that should still work"
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Time commands
time aichaku principles list
time aichaku principles show dry
time aichaku integrate

# Memory usage
/usr/bin/time -l aichaku principles list
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Issues**: Have fallback optimization strategies ready
2. **Bug Discovery**: Allocate buffer time for fixes
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Get early feedback from test users
4. **Integration Issues**: Test with real projects

## Notes

- Focus on user experience and reliability
- Keep changes minimal to avoid introducing new bugs
- Document any known limitations for future improvement
- Prepare handoff documentation for cool-down phase
