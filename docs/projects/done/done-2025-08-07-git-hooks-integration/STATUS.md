# Git Hooks Integration - Status

## ðŸŒ¿ Project Status: Building â†’ Complete

**Started**: 2025-08-07\
**Appetite**: Small (2-3 days)\
**Team**: Solo developer\
**Priority**: Medium-High (enhances value proposition)

## Current Phase

### [âœ“] Problem Definition

- Git hooks are manually copied between projects
- No standardization across teams
- Maintenance burden in dotfiles
- `aichaku hooks` already exists for Claude Code hooks

### [âœ“] Solution Shaping

- Defined git hooks storage in `~/.claude/aichaku/githooks/`
- Planned `aichaku githooks` command interface
- Namespace strategy for conflicts (`.aichaku-githooks/`)
- Integration with existing commands

### [âœ“] Building

- [x] Create git hooks management system (`GitHookManager` class)
- [x] Implement `aichaku githooks` command
- [x] Add namespace detection and conflict handling
- [x] Copy hooks to template directory
- [x] All tests passing
- [x] Update documentation (README created)
- [x] Test hook disabled by default (as per requirements)

### [âœ“] Implementation Complete

- All features implemented and tested
- Test hook issue addressed (disabled by default)
- Documentation updated with clear warnings
- Ready for release
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Platform testing

## Key Decisions

1. **Include git hooks in aichaku**: Yes - aligns with comprehensive methodology support
2. **Command name**: `aichaku githooks` (not `hooks` - that's for Claude Code)
3. **Default location**: `.githooks/` with `.aichaku-githooks/` as fallback
4. **Make it optional**: Never force, always ask
5. **Storage location**: `~/.claude/aichaku/githooks/` alongside other resources

## Open Questions

1. Should we support Node.js-specific hooks too?
2. How to handle hook updates in existing projects?
3. Should hooks be language-aware (detect Deno vs Node)?

## Implementation Notes

- Hooks already exist in current repo's `.githooks/`
- Need to move them to core distribution
- Must preserve executable permissions
- Consider Deno-based replacements for shell scripts

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the pitch
2. Create implementation plan
3. Start with hooks storage structure
4. Build command interface
5. Test with fresh and existing projects

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Clean installation on new projects
- [ ] Non-disruptive installation on existing projects
- [ ] All hooks working cross-platform
- [ ] Clear documentation and examples
- [ ] No performance regression
