## Problem

Users expect `aichaku upgrade` to upgrade everything but must run two commands:

1. `aichaku upgrade` - updates mysterious "metadata"
2. `aichaku integrate --force` - updates CLAUDE.md

This is confusing and unnatural.

## Solution

Make `aichaku upgrade` automatically update CLAUDE.md when run in projects.

## Implementation Plan

1. Modify upgrade.ts to detect project upgrades
2. Call integrate() automatically after upgrade
3. Update messages to be clearer
4. Keep integrate as standalone for special cases
