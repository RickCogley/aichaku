# 🌿 Project Status: Deno.json Surgical Exclusion

**Phase**: 🌳 Building → Complete\
**Progress**: Week 1/1 ████████████████████ 100% 🍃\
**Status**: ✅ Successfully Implemented & Released

## Summary

Successfully implemented top-level exclude configuration in deno.json to fix nagare release failures. The solution was
tested and deployed in release v0.30.0.

## Key Achievements

✅ **Problem Identified**: Nagare's type checking was failing on deprecated v2 files\
✅ **Root Cause Found**: `deno check` behavior varies with arguments\
✅ **Solution Implemented**: Top-level exclude configuration\
✅ **Testing Completed**: Verified with dry runs and actual release\
✅ **Documentation Created**: Comprehensive findings documented\
✅ **Release Successful**: v0.30.0 published with the fix

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

- `deno.json` - Added top-level exclude configuration
- `nagare.config.ts` - Updated pre-release hook to use `deno check` without args
- Created comprehensive documentation of findings

### Key Learning

The top-level `exclude` in deno.json only works when running `deno check` without arguments (not with `deno check .` or
`deno check **/*.ts`).

## Next Steps

This project is now complete. The solution has been:

- ✅ Implemented
- ✅ Tested
- ✅ Documented
- ✅ Released

## Project Completion

**Completion Date**: 2025-08-01\
**Final Status**: 🍃 COMPLETED - All Deno.json surgical exclusion objectives met and project deliverables completed.

This project has been successfully finished and is ready to be moved to the done directory.
