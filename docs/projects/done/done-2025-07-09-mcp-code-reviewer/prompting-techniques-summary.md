# MCP Prompting Techniques Summary

🪴 Aichaku: How Advanced Prompting Makes Reviews More Effective

## Techniques Incorporated

### 1. **Multi-Shot Prompting** ✅

Shows both bad and good examples side-by-side:

````text
❌ Bad: const data: any = response
✅ Good: const data: ApiResponse = response
```text

Claude learns by seeing the contrast.

### 2. **Context & Related Information** ✅

Explains WHY rules exist:

```text
Context: TypeScript's type system prevents runtime errors.
Using 'any' disables this protection and makes code harder to maintain.
```text

Understanding the "why" creates lasting behavior change.

### 3. **Decomposition** ✅

Breaks complex fixes into manageable subtasks:

```text
Step-by-Step Fix:

1. Look at how the variable is used

2. Create an interface with those properties

3. Replace 'any' with your interface

4. Fix any resulting type errors
```text

Prevents overwhelm and ensures completeness.

### 4. **Sequencing** ✅

For security issues, emphasizes order:

```text

1. STOP - Do not run this code until fixed

2. Replace string interpolation with array arguments

3. Use execFile instead of exec when possible

4. Validate/sanitize any user input
```text

Critical issues get proper priority.

### 5. **Self-Reflection** ✅

Prompts introspection with targeted questions:

```text
🤔 Reflection: What made me reach for 'any' instead of defining a proper type?
🤔 Reflection: Am I treating user input as potentially malicious in all cases?
```text

Builds awareness of patterns.

### 6. **Step-by-Step Thinking** ✅

Guides through the thought process:

```text

1. Analysis: First, trace through the code...

2. Strategy: Create a minimal interface...

3. Implementation: Replace 'any' with your interface...
```text

Models good problem-solving approach.

## Example: Complete Enhanced Feedback

When Claude uses 'any' types:

```text
🌱 Learning Opportunity - Let's fix this properly:

📖 Context: TypeScript's type system prevents runtime errors. Using 'any'
disables this protection and makes code harder to maintain.

⚠️ Issue: Using 'any' instead of proper TypeScript types
Reminder: 📝 Your CLAUDE.md explicitly states to avoid 'any' types, but you used it 5 times.

❌ Bad Example:
const data: any = response

✅ Good Example:
interface UserData { id: string; name: string; }
const user: UserData = await getUser(id);

🔄 Step-by-Step Fix:

1. Look at how the variable is used (what properties/methods are accessed)

2. Create an interface with those properties

3. Replace 'any' with your interface

4. Fix any resulting type errors

🤔 Reflection: What made me reach for 'any' instead of defining a proper type?

📌 Note to self: I should follow the TypeScript standards in CLAUDE.md and avoid using 'any' types.
```text

## Impact on Claude's Behavior

### Before (Simple Feedback)

```text
MCP: "Found 5 'any' types"
Claude: "I'll fix those type issues"
[May make same mistake again]
```text

### After (Advanced Prompting)

```text
MCP: [Detailed guidance with examples, context, and steps]
Claude: "I understand now - using 'any' defeats TypeScript's purpose.
         Let me properly type these by examining usage patterns first..."
[Less likely to repeat mistake]
```text

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Faster Learning**: Examples show exactly what to do

2. **Deeper Understanding**: Context explains why it matters

3. **Practical Guidance**: Steps prevent confusion

4. **Behavioral Change**: Reflection creates awareness

5. **Better Code**: Claude produces higher quality on first try

## Key Insight

By using these prompting techniques, the MCP becomes more than a reviewer - it
becomes an effective teacher that helps Claude internalize best practices and
write better code throughout the session.

The combination of:

- **WHY** (context)

- **WHAT** (examples)

- **HOW** (steps)

- **REFLECT** (questions)

Creates a powerful learning loop that improves code quality in real-time.
