# MVP Experiment Plan - Marketplace Idea

**Hypothesis**: Small businesses need a simple way to sell services online without complex e-commerce setup

**MVP Timeline**: 5 days (January 6-10, 2025)

## What We're Testing

1. **Problem Validation**: Do small service businesses struggle with current solutions?
2. **Solution Appeal**: Will a simplified marketplace attract them?
3. **Willingness to Pay**: Will they pay 5% transaction fee?

## Minimum Viable Product

### What's In (Absolute Minimum)

- Landing page explaining concept
- Simple signup form
- Mock service listing page
- Basic search (fake results OK)
- Contact button (goes to email)

### What's Out (Save for Later)

- ❌ Payment processing
- ❌ User accounts
- ❌ Real search algorithm
- ❌ Mobile app
- ❌ Reviews/ratings
- ❌ Messaging system

## Build Plan

### Day 1-2: Landing Page

- Value proposition
- Signup CTA
- Track conversion rate

### Day 3-4: Mock Marketplace

- 10 fake service listings
- Basic category filter
- Contact buttons

### Day 5: Launch & Measure

- Share with 50 target businesses
- Track signups and contacts

## Success Metrics

| Metric                | Target | Actual |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| Landing page visitors | 500    | -      |
| Signup conversion     | 10%    | -      |
| Contact attempts      | 20     | -      |
| Positive feedback     | 60%    | -      |

## Learning Goals

1. Is the problem real and painful?
2. Does our solution resonate?
3. What features do they actually want?
4. What would they pay?

## Next Steps

**If successful** (>10% conversion):

- Build real MVP with payments
- Onboard beta users
- 2-week development cycle

**If unsuccessful** (<5% conversion):

- Interview non-converters
- Pivot to different problem
- Try new audience

**If mixed** (5-10% conversion):

- Iterate on messaging
- A/B test pricing
- Narrow target market

## Notes

Remember: We're testing the idea, not building a product. Fake it till we validate it!
