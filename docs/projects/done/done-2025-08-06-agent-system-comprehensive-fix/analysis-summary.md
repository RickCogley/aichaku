# Analysis Summary: Previous Agent Work

## Projects Reviewed

### 1. 2025-07-31 Agent Management System (Active)

- **Original Goal**: 2-3 day implementation of `aichaku agents` command
- **Status**: Partially implemented but broken
- **Key Points**:
  - Intended simple kebab-case IDs (deno-expert, TypeScript-expert)
  - Planned default vs optional agent distinction
  - Focused context injection to reduce token usage
  - AgentsCommand using BaseCommand pattern

### 2. 2025-07-25 Sub-Agent Methodology Focus (Done)

- **Goal**: Comprehensive agent ecosystem with orchestration
- **Status**: Architecture designed, partially implemented
- **Key Points**:
  - Orchestrator as general coordinator (not just docs)
  - Specialized agents for different domains
  - Delegation patterns between agents
  - Context management to reduce bloat (12k → 4k tokens)
  - Technology-specific experts planned

### 3. 2025-07-29 Agent Customization System (Active)

- **Goal**: Allow user customizations without breaking updates
- **Status**: Not implemented
- **Key Points**:
  - Three-layer system (core, customizations, generated)
  - YAML overlays for user modifications
  - Non-destructive updates
  - Preserve customizations across upgrades

### 4. 2025-07-28 Principles Guidance System (Active)

- **Status**: Related but not directly about agents
- **Relevance**: Similar pattern to agents (loader, formatter, command)

## Current State vs Original Vision

### What Was Built

✅ AgentsCommand exists and uses BaseCommand ✅ AgentLoader and AgentFormatter created ✅ Basic add/remove functionality
works (with wrong IDs) ✅ Agent templates exist somewhere

### What's Broken

❌ IDs are full names ("Aichaku Deno Expert") not kebab-case ❌ Agent templates can't be found properly ❌ Search output
is messy with duplicates ❌ Integration doesn't copy agent files ❌ No clear default vs optional distinction ❌ Focused
context injection not working

### What Was Never Built

⚠️ Orchestrator implementation ⚠️ Delegation patterns ⚠️ Customization layer ⚠️ Technology-specific experts ⚠️ Agent
communication protocols

## Root Causes of Current Issues

1. **Path Resolution Problem**: Agent templates expected in wrong location
2. **ID Generation Bug**: Using filename/metadata name instead of proper ID field
3. **Incomplete Implementation**: Original 2-3 day work partially done
4. **Missing Integration**: `aichaku integrate` never updated to copy agents
5. **No Testing**: Agent functionality not properly tested

## Conflicts Between Projects

- **Date Format Issue**: Folder shows 2025-01-31 but should be 2025-07-31
- **Scope Creep**: Simple command → full ecosystem → customization system
- **Implementation Gaps**: Each project assumes previous work complete

## Recommended Approach

### Priority 1: Fix What's Broken (Week 1-2)

- Fix ID generation to use kebab-case
- Fix path discovery for agent templates
- Fix search and display formatting
- Fix integration to actually copy files

### Priority 2: Complete Original Vision (Week 3)

- Implement default vs optional agents
- Add focused context injection
- Complete testing

### Priority 3: Future Enhancements (Not in this cycle)

- Customization system (separate project)
- Additional technology experts
- Orchestrator improvements

## Key Decisions Needed

1. **Scope**: Fix current issues only, or expand to customization?
2. **IDs**: Confirm kebab-case format (deno-expert, TypeScript-expert)
3. **Templates**: Where should agent templates actually live?
4. **Integration**: How should agents be copied during integrate?
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: How to migrate existing broken installations?

## Recommendations

1. **Keep scope focused**: Fix the broken command first (4 weeks)
2. **Use original simple design**: kebab-case IDs, basic add/remove
3. **Defer customization**: Make it work before making it customizable
4. **Add comprehensive tests**: Prevent future regressions
5. **Document clearly**: Where agents live, how they work
