# Project Status: Agent Truth Protocol

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Merged to main

**Started**: 2025-08-09\
**Completed**: 2025-08-11\
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Trust issue

## Current Phase

[Shaping] → [Betting] → [Building] → [**Cool-down**]\

## Problem Statement

Agents are reporting work as complete (especially file creation) without verification. This breaks user trust and wastes
time when assumptions prove false.

## Solution Approach

1. **Truth Protocol** - Mandatory verification of all state-changing claims
2. **Orchestrator Verification** - Check agent claims before reporting
3. **Guided Testing Mode** - Collaborative verification with users

## Progress Log

- 2025-08-09: Project initiated after false file creation report in nagare project
- 2025-08-09: Shaping problem and solution approach
- 2025-08-09: Started implementation on feat/agent-truth-protocol branch
- 2025-08-09: Implemented core TruthVerifier class with tests (all passing)
- 2025-08-09: Created TruthfulAgent base class (needs testing)
- 2025-08-09: Updated 4 critical agents with Truth Protocol:
  - ✅ orchestrator (gatekeeper role) - commit 8f8bb77
  - ✅ test-expert (HIGH RISK - test files) - commit 541efca
  - ✅ documenter (HIGH RISK - most files) - commit fabf53f (properly done)
  - ✅ TypeScript-expert (HIGH PRIORITY - code files) - commit fabf53f (properly done)
- 2025-08-11: All remaining agents updated with Truth Protocol - commit a0b3b00
- 2025-08-11: Merged to main via PR #3 - commit df65929
- 2025-08-11: Released in v0.47.0

## Implementation Status

### Completed

- [x] Core TruthVerifier class with comprehensive tests
- [x] TruthfulAgent base class for all agents
- [x] Orchestrator agent updated with verification layer
- [x] Documenter agent with mandatory file verification
- [x] Test-expert with guided testing patterns
- [x] TypeScript-expert with type-check verification
- [x] Agent implementation checklist created
- [x] All 18 agents updated with Truth Protocol
- [x] Integration testing completed
- [x] Documentation and migration guide created
- [x] Merged to main branch (PR #3)
- [x] Released in v0.47.0

## Result

The Truth Protocol was successfully implemented across all agents and released. However, the upgrade process had a bug
that prevented the updated agents from being deployed to users' systems, which is now being fixed in the
upgrade-force-and-messaging project.
