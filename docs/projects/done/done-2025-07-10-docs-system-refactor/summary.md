# Documentation System Refactor - Project Summary

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive documentation overhaul for Aichaku using the Di치taxis framework combined with Google
Developer Documentation Style Guide. This refactor established professional documentation standards, created linting
tools, and reorganized the entire documentation structure.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Di치taxis Framework Implementation

- Reorganized documentation into four clear categories: tutorials, how-to guides, reference, and explanation
- Created `.diataxis` configuration for structure enforcement
- Split mixed-purpose documents into focused, single-purpose guides

### 2. Google Style Guide Adoption

- Implemented conversational tone with "you/your" pronouns
- Enforced present tense and active voice throughout
- Applied 20-word sentence limit for clarity
- Removed unnecessary filler words

### 3. Documentation Standards Feature

- Created `aichaku docs-standard` command for managing documentation standards
- Developed support for multiple style guides (Di치taxis + Google, Microsoft, Write the Docs)
- Integrated with existing `aichaku integrate` command
- Added comprehensive templates for each document type

### 4. Documentation Linting System

- Implemented `aichaku docs-lint` command for automated quality checks
- Created extensible linter architecture with base class
- Built specific linters for Di치taxis structure and Google style compliance
- Provides clear, actionable feedback on documentation issues

### 5. MCP Server Documentation

- Created complete documentation suite covering setup, usage, API, and architecture
- Clarified global installation model and multi-project support
- Explained stdio communication architecture

## Technical Implementation

- **New Commands**: `docs-standard` and `docs-lint`
- **Files Created**: 29 new files including commands, linters, standards, and documentation
- **Files Modified**: 7 core files for integration
- **Files Removed**: 6 outdated mixed-purpose documents
- **Security**: Fixed path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations
- **Testing**: 22 comprehensive tests ensuring reliability

## Impact

This refactor transformed Aichaku's documentation from a basic collection of files into a professional, maintainable
documentation system that:

- Provides clear learning paths for new users
- Offers task-focused guides for common operations
- Maintains comprehensive reference materials
- Explains architectural decisions and concepts
- Enforces quality standards automatically

## Next Steps

- Consider renaming `/references` to `/docs` for convention
- Enhance linting capabilities with additional checks
- Add documentation metrics and coverage reports
- Create VS Code extension for real-time documentation linting

The documentation system is now ready to scale with the project and maintain quality as it grows.
