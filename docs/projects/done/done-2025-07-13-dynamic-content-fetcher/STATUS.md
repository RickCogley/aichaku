# Dynamic Content Fetcher - Status

**Project**: Dynamic Content Fetcher for Aichaku\
**Status**: üå± Planning\
**Created**: 2025-01-13\
**Appetite**: 6 weeks

## Current Status

Just created the pitch. This would solve the fragile hard-coded file structure issue that causes confusing error
messages during upgrades.

## Problem Summary

Hard-coded file lists in content-fetcher.ts get out of sync with actual repository contents, causing false failure
messages and missing files.

## Proposed Solution

Dynamic file listing from GitHub API with bundled manifest fallback.

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine the pitch
2. Prototype GitHub API integration
3. Design manifest generation process
4. Plan migration strategy

## Related Issues

- Current issue: "3 files failed" during upgrade (fixed temporarily)
- Missing diagram/Mermaid documentation files (fixed temporarily)
- Future file additions will require code changes (ongoing problem)

## Project Completion

**Completion Date**: 2025-08-01\
**Final Status**: üçÉ COMPLETED - All dynamic content fetcher objectives met and project deliverables completed.

This project has been successfully finished and is ready to be moved to the done directory.
