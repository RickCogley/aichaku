# 2025-01-10 Standards Integration Checkpoint

## Project Overview

ðŸª´ Aichaku: Implementing modular standards integration for enhanced prompt
engineering

## Completed Work

### 1. âœ… Hooks Command Implementation

- Created `aichaku hooks` command for Claude Code hook management
- Implemented hook templates for path validation, status updates, and
  methodology detection
- Fixed multiple issues:
  - Missing utility files (colors.ts, spinner.ts, symbols.ts)
  - JSON parsing error with comments in ~/.claude/settings.json
  - Color references and import issues
- Successfully tested with `--list` and `--install basic` options
- **File created**: `/src/commands/hooks.ts`

### 2. âœ… Standards Command Implementation

- Created `aichaku standards` command for modular guidance selection
- Implemented user choice interface with categories:
  - Security (OWASP, NIST CSF, GDPR, PCI-DSS)
  - Architecture (15-Factor, DDD, Clean Architecture, Microservices)
  - Development (Google Style, Conventional Commits, SOLID, TDD)
  - Testing (BDD, Test Pyramid)
  - DevOps (SRE, GitOps, DORA)
- Added support for:
  - `--add` - Add standards (supports comma-separated values)
  - `--remove` - Remove standards
  - `--show` - Display current standards
  - `--list` - List available standards
  - `--search` - Search for standards
- Fixed issues:
  - Comma-separated parsing for multiple standards
  - Boolean vs string option conflict for --remove
- Incorporated user feedback:
  - Emphasized user choice over auto-detection
  - Better UX showing what users CAN do with multiple options
  - Consistent ðŸª´ Aichaku branding throughout
- **File created**: `/src/commands/standards.ts`

### 3. âœ… Enhanced Integrate Command

- Updated `integrate` command to support both methodology and standards sections
- Implemented dual marker system:
  - `<!-- AICHAKU:METHODOLOGY:START/END -->` for methodology rules
  - `<!-- AICHAKU:STANDARDS:START/END -->` for selected standards
- Created comprehensive standard content files:
  - `~/.claude/docs/standards/security/owasp-web.md` - OWASP Top 10 Web
    Application Security
  - `~/.claude/docs/standards/architecture/15-factor.md` - 15-Factor App
    Methodology
  - `~/.claude/docs/standards/development/tdd.md` - Test-Driven Development
  - `~/.claude/docs/standards/security/nist-csf.md` - NIST Cybersecurity
    Framework
- Features:
  - Surgical updates preserving existing content
  - Dynamic content loading based on selected standards
  - Automatic cleanup when no standards are selected
  - Proper formatting with separators between standards
- Successfully tested integration with multiple standards
- **File modified**: `/src/commands/integrate.ts`

### 4. âœ… CLI Updates

- Added hooks command to CLI
- Added standards command to CLI
- Proper option parsing for both commands
- **File modified**: `/cli.ts`

## Key User Insights

- **User's name**: Rick
- **Emphasized**: "world-famous aichaku branding" (ðŸª´)
- **Focus**: User choice over auto-detection
- **UX Priority**: Clear next steps showing what users CAN do, not just required
  actions
- **Integration Purpose**: Standards in CLAUDE.md for proactive code
  generation + same standards for MCP-based reactive review
- **Workflow Vision**: Dual-purpose standards system for both generation and
  review

## Current State

### Working Features

- All major features for standards integration are implemented and tested
- The system now supports modular guidance with user choice
- Enhanced integrate command successfully creates/updates CLAUDE.md with both
  methodology and selected standards
- Clear workflow established: select standards â†’ integrate â†’ code generation
  with standards awareness

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Select standards
aichaku standards --add owasp-web,15-factor,tdd

# 2. Review selections
aichaku standards --show

# 3. Integrate into CLAUDE.md
aichaku integrate

# 4. Claude Code now uses these standards for code generation
```

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. **Implement role-based prompting system** (pending)

- Design system for different development roles/contexts
- Integrate with hooks for dynamic prompt adjustment

### 2. **Resolve SECURITY_WORKFLOWS.md placement** (pending)

- Determine proper location for security workflow documentation
- Integrate with existing security standards

### 3. **Create MCP code reviewer** (pending)

- Concept completed
- Implementation needed for reactive code review using selected standards

## Technical Implementation Details

### Standards Storage Structure

```
~/.claude/
â”œâ”€â”€ standards/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ security/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ owasp-web.md
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nist-csf.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ architecture/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 15-factor.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ development/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tdd.md
```

### Project Configuration

```json
// .claude/.aichaku-standards.json
{
  "selected": ["owasp-web", "15-factor", "tdd"]
}
```

### CLAUDE.md Structure

```markdown
<!-- AICHAKU:METHODOLOGY:START -->

[Aichaku methodology rules]

<!-- AICHAKU:METHODOLOGY:END -->

<!-- AICHAKU:STANDARDS:START -->

[Selected standards content]

<!-- AICHAKU:STANDARDS:END -->
```

## Next Steps

1. Continue with role-based prompting system implementation
2. Create MCP server for code review functionality
3. Document the complete workflow in README.md
4. Consider creating video demonstration of the new features
