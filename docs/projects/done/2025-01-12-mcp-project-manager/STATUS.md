**Current Phase**: ðŸŒ± Shaping

## Progress Indicator

[**Shaping**] â†’ [Betting] â†’ [Building] â†’ [Cool-down] â–²

## Status Summary

Just created the initial pitch based on discussion about:

- Need for precise project lifecycle management
- Automated documentation generation
- Consistent file placement

## Next Actions

- [ ] Review and refine the pitch
- [ ] Decide on folder naming convention
- [ ] Design MCP tool interfaces

## Decisions Made

1. Remove redundant prefixes from folder names
2. Create MCP tools for consistency
3. Focus on precision and lifecycle completion

## Open Questions

- Should we migrate existing folders now or after tools are built?
- What additional metadata should STATUS.md track?
- How to handle projects that span multiple git branches?
