# Release Notes: MCP HTTP/SSE Server Implementation

## Summary

This release introduces a major enhancement to the Aichaku MCP server with HTTP/SSE (Server-Sent Events) support,
enabling multiple Claude Code instances to share a single MCP server efficiently. This addresses the performance and
resource concerns when running multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously.

## üåü Major Features

### HTTP/SSE Server Mode

- **NEW**: Persistent HTTP/SSE server mode for Aichaku MCP server
- **Port**: 7182 (AICHAKU on phone keypad)
- **Benefits**:
  - Efficient resource usage across multiple Claude Code instances
  - Faster response times (no process startup overhead)
  - Cross-platform network compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - Session-based architecture with UUID identification

### Automatic Mode Detection

- Claude Code automatically detects and uses HTTP/SSE server when available
- Graceful fallback to process mode when server not running
- Seamless user experience - no configuration changes needed

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Server Architecture

- Session-based HTTP/SSE server with UUID tracking
- JSON-RPC over HTTP with Server-Sent Events for responses
- Automatic session cleanup after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Health check endpoint for monitoring

### API Endpoints

- `POST /rpc` - JSON-RPC request handling
- `GET /sse` - Server-Sent Events response stream
- `GET /health` - Server health and session count
- `DELETE /session` - Session termination

### Client Implementation

- Custom SSE client (Deno lacks native EventSource)
- Manual SSE parsing with proper error handling
- Response queuing and session management
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss

## üõ†Ô∏è New Commands

```bash
# Start HTTP/SSE server
aichaku mcp --start-server

# Check server status
aichaku mcp --server-status

# Stop HTTP/SSE server
aichaku mcp --stop-server
```

## üìã Updated Documentation

### Enhanced MCP Documentation

- Updated MCP-SERVER.md with HTTP/SSE architecture diagrams
- Clear explanation of when to use each mode:
  - **Aichaku MCP**: Supports both process and HTTP/SSE modes (heavy initialization, frequent use)
  - **GitHub MCP**: Process-only mode (lightweight, occasional use)
- Added troubleshooting and performance optimization guides

### README Updates

- Simplified HTTP/SSE server introduction
- Updated examples showing automatic server detection
- Clear migration path from process-only to server mode

## üîß Bug Fixes

### TypeScript Errors Resolved

- Fixed socket server transport specification
- Improved error handling with proper type guards
- Resolved 6 TypeScript compilation errors

### Format and Lint Issues

- Applied consistent formatting across codebase
- Fixed verbatim module syntax warnings
- Cleaned up unused variable warnings in test files

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### Resource Efficiency

- Shared server reduces memory footprint
- Eliminates process startup time for subsequent requests
- Session pooling for optimal resource utilization

### Network Optimization

- HTTP/SSE provides better network reliability than stdio
- Firewall-friendly HTTP protocol
- Proper connection management and cleanup

## üîÑ Migration Path

### For Existing Users

1. **No action required** - existing process mode continues to work
2. **Optional upgrade** - run `aichaku mcp --start-server` for improved performance
3. **Automatic detection** - CLI automatically uses server when available

### For Multiple Claude Code Instances

1. Start server once: `aichaku mcp --start-server`
2. All subsequent `aichaku review` commands use the shared server
3. Improved performance and resource usage immediately

## üß™ Testing and Quality Assurance

### Pre-flight Checks Completed

- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation (195 files)
- ‚úÖ Code formatting verification
- ‚úÖ Basic lint checks passed
- ‚úÖ Core functionality testing

### Known Issues (Minor)

- 29 lint warnings in test files (non-blocking)
- Some unused variables in development utilities
- Minor require-await patterns in legacy code

## üí° Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

- TCP server mode as alternative to HTTP/SSE
- Enhanced session management and persistence
- Metrics and monitoring for server performance
- Load balancing for high-traffic scenarios

### GitHub MCP Server

- Remains process-only by design
- Lightweight for occasional GitHub operations
- No server mode needed due to usage patterns

## üîó Architecture Comparison

| Aspect               | Process Mode                 | HTTP/SSE Server Mode           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Resource Usage**   | High (new process each time) | Low (shared server)            |
| **Startup Time**     | Slow (process spawn)         | Fast (persistent server)       |
| **Concurrency**      | Single request               | Multiple sessions              |
| **Platform Support** | All platforms                | All platforms                  |
| **Network Friendly** | No (stdio only)              | Yes (HTTP protocol)            |
| **Use Case**         | Occasional use               | Frequent use, multiple clients |
