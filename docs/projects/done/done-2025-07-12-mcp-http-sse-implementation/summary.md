# MCP HTTP/SSE Server Implementation - Project Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented HTTP/SSE (Server-Sent Events) server mode for the
Aichaku MCP server, enabling multiple Claude Code instances to share a single
persistent server. This major enhancement addresses performance and resource
concerns when running multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously.

## Key Achievements

### 1. HTTP/SSE Server Architecture

- Built persistent HTTP server on port 7182 (AICHAKU on phone keypad)
- Implemented session-based architecture with UUID tracking
- Created JSON-RPC over HTTP with SSE for asynchronous responses
- Added automatic session cleanup after 5 minutes of inactivity

### 2. Seamless Integration

- Claude Code automatically detects and uses HTTP/SSE server when available
- Graceful fallback to process mode when server not running
- No configuration changes required from users
- Maintains full backward compatibility

### 3. Custom SSE Client

- Developed custom SSE client (Deno lacks native EventSource)
- Implemented manual SSE parsing with proper error handling
- Built response queuing and session management
- Added automatic reconnection on connection loss

### 4. New CLI Commands

- `aichaku mcp --start-server` - Launch persistent server
- `aichaku mcp --server-status` - Check server health
- `aichaku mcp --stop-server` - Gracefully shutdown server

### 5. Performance Improvements

- Eliminated process startup overhead for subsequent requests
- Reduced memory footprint through shared server architecture
- Improved response times for frequently used operations
- Better resource utilization across multiple Claude Code instances

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints

- `POST /rpc` - JSON-RPC request handling
- `GET /sse` - Server-Sent Events response stream
- `GET /health` - Server health and session monitoring
- `DELETE /session` - Clean session termination

### Architecture Benefits

| Aspect          | Process Mode       | HTTP/SSE Server   |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Resource Usage  | High (new process) | Low (shared)      |
| Startup Time    | Slow               | Fast              |
| Concurrency     | Single request     | Multiple sessions |
| Network Support | stdio only         | HTTP protocol     |

## Bug Fixes and Quality

- Resolved 6 TypeScript compilation errors
- Fixed socket server transport specifications
- Applied consistent code formatting
- Cleaned up lint warnings and unused variables
- Passed all pre-flight checks (195 TypeScript files)

## Documentation Updates

- Enhanced MCP-SERVER.md with architecture diagrams
- Added clear mode selection guidance
- Updated README with simplified introduction
- Created troubleshooting guides

## Impact

This implementation transforms Aichaku MCP from a single-instance tool to an
enterprise-ready solution that efficiently handles multiple concurrent users.
Teams can now:

- Run multiple Claude Code instances without resource concerns
- Experience faster response times on frequent operations
- Benefit from improved reliability through HTTP protocol
- Scale their development workflow efficiently

## Migration Path

Existing users experience zero disruption:

1. Current process mode continues working unchanged
2. Optional upgrade via `aichaku mcp --start-server`
3. Automatic detection ensures seamless transition

## Future Potential

This foundation enables:

- TCP server mode as alternative transport
- Enhanced monitoring and metrics
- Load balancing capabilities
- Advanced session persistence

The HTTP/SSE server establishes Aichaku as a scalable, professional-grade tool
ready for team environments and heavy usage patterns.
