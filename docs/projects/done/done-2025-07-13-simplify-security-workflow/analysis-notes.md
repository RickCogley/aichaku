# Security Workflow Analysis Notes

## Current Issues with Custom Security Checks

### 1. Path Traversal Check Issues

The pattern that caused the most problems:

```bash
"(Deno\.(readFile|readTextFile|open|stat|lstat|readDir|remove|rename|mkdir)|fs\.(readFile|writeFile|readdir|stat|unlink|rename|mkdir))\s*\(\s*[a-zA-Z*$][a-zA-Z0-9*$]*\s*[,)]"
```

This pattern matches ANY file operation with a variable, which is standard programming practice. Examples of false
positives:

- `await Deno.readTextFile(configPath)`
- `await Deno.mkdir(dir, { recursive: true })`
- `await Deno.stat(serverPath)`

### 2. Maintenance Burden

The exclusion list in the workflow has grown to over 1000 characters and is still not comprehensive enough. Each new
file operation requires updating the exclusions.

### 3. What DevSkim Already Covers

- Hardcoded secrets and credentials
- Dangerous functions (eval, Function constructor)
- SQL injection patterns
- Command injection
- Path traversal (with better context awareness)
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- And many more...

### 4. What CodeQL Already Covers

- Semantic analysis of code flow
- Taint tracking (following user input through code)
- Complex vulnerability patterns
- Path traversal with data flow analysis
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Authentication/authorization issues
- And much more with better accuracy...

## Recommendations

### Keep These Custom Checks

1. **Hardcoded secrets check** - But only if it catches things DevSkim misses
2. **Project-specific patterns** - Things unique to Aichaku

### Remove These Custom Checks

1. **Path traversal vulnerabilities** - CodeQL does this better with semantic analysis
2. **Dangerous patterns (eval, etc.)** - DevSkim already covers these
3. **Generic security patterns** - Covered by both tools

### Benefits of Simplification

1. **Fewer false positives** - Professional tools have better context awareness
2. **Easier maintenance** - No need to maintain complex exclusion patterns
3. **Better coverage** - Professional tools are constantly updated
4. **Faster CI/CD** - Less redundant checking
5. **Clearer failures** - When something fails, it's more likely a real issue

## Implementation Plan

1. Create comparison table of what each tool covers
2. Remove redundant checks one by one
3. Test with known vulnerabilities to ensure coverage
4. Document the security scanning strategy
5. Update contributing docs to explain which tool catches what
