# 2025-07-07 Improve Aichaku Directives - Change Log

## Summary

Enhanced Aichaku's CLAUDE.md integration to stop Claude Code from asking permission to create files and to use
descriptive change log naming.

## Problem

1. Claude Code kept asking "Would you like me to create STATUS.md?" despite directives saying not to ask
2. CHANGE-LOG.md naming was generic, making PDFs hard to identify

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added "CRITICAL: NO ASKING, JUST CREATE" Section

New section in `src/commands/integrate.ts` that:

- Explicitly states to create standard Aichaku documents immediately
- Lists phrases to NEVER use:
  - "Would you like me to create..."
  - "Shall I create..."
  - "Should I make..."
  - "Do you want me to..."
- Lists phrases to ALWAYS use:
  - "Creating STATUS.md..."
  - "I'll create pitch.md..."
  - "Writing the planning document..."
  - "Generating [document]..."

### 2. Updated CHANGE-LOG Naming Convention

Modified Section 4 to specify:

- New format: `YYYY-MM-DD-{Project-Name}-CHANGE-LOG.md`
- Examples provided:
  - `2025-07-07-Fix-Security-Tests-CHANGE-LOG.md`
  - `2025-07-07-Update-Authentication-CHANGE-LOG.md`
- Explicit directive: "NEVER just 'CHANGE-LOG.md'"

## Changes Made

- Modified `METHODOLOGY_SECTION` constant in `src/commands/integrate.ts`
- Added new Section 2: "CRITICAL: NO ASKING, JUST CREATE"
- Updated Section 4: "Completing Work" with new naming convention
- Renumbered sections (now 6 total instead of 5)

## Impact

- Claude Code should stop asking permission for standard documents
- Change logs will have descriptive names for easy identification
- PDFs generated from change logs will be self-identifying
- More magical, automatic experience for users

## Status

âœ… Complete - Ready for testing with next `aichaku integrate` run
