   - Removed `.claude/output/` directory
   - Removed old `.aichaku.json` file

## Benefits

- âœ… No more duplicated methodology files in the repository

## Migration Path for Other Projects

This same process can be used for any project with old aichaku structure:

1. Move `.claude/output/*` to `docs/projects/`
2. Remove `.claude/methodologies/` and `.claude/.aichaku.json`
3. Run `aichaku init --force`
4. Commit the changes
