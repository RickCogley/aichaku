# 2025-07-07 Create Test Files - Change Log

## Summary

Created a basic test suite for Aichaku with 9 passing tests across core
functionality.

## Problem

No test files existed in the project, causing the Security Tests workflow to
fail with "No test modules found" error.

## Solution Implemented

### Test Files Created

1. **src/commands/init_test.ts** (3 tests)

   - Tests init function exists and returns correct type

   - Tests dry run functionality

   - Tests handling of existing installations

2. **src/commands/integrate_test.ts** (3 tests)

   - Tests integrate function exists and returns correct type

   - Tests dry run functionality

   - Tests correct path return

3. **src/mod_test.ts** (3 tests)

   - Tests all required functions are exported

   - Tests version information exports
