# Security and Diagram Fixes

## Security Analysis Results

### Good News! âœ…

GitHub shows **no security alerts or vulnerabilities** for Aichaku. The
comprehensive security scan revealed:

1. **No hardcoded secrets** - Clean codebase

2. **Dependencies are minimal and current** - All @std packages at latest
   versions

3. **Strong security practices**:

   - Multiple security scanning workflows (CodeQL, DevSkim, dependency review)

   - OWASP Top 10 compliance documented

   - Zero npm dependencies in main code

   - Path validation and input sanitization

### Fixed Issues

#### 1. **Publish Workflow Test Bypass** ðŸ”§

- **Problem**: Tests were allowed to fail with `|| true`

- **Impact**: Could allow broken code to be published

- **Fix**: Removed `|| true` to enforce test passing

- **Files**: `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (lines 47, 55)

#### 2. **XP TDD Diagram** ðŸ“Š

- **Problem**: Arrows were misaligned and cycle was confusing

- **Fix**: Redesigned as linear flow with clear steps:

  - Red Test â†’ Green â†’ Refactor â†’ Repeat

- **File**: `src/commands/help.ts`

## Verification

All diagrams now display correctly:

- âœ… Shape Up cycle diagram

- âœ… Scrum flow diagram

- âœ… Kanban board visualization

- âœ… Lean Build-Measure-Learn cycle

- âœ… XP TDD cycle (fixed)

- âœ… Scrumban hybrid flow

## Security Recommendations

While the codebase is secure, continue to:

1. Monitor the third-party `@rick/nagare` dependency

2. Keep Deno standard library dependencies updated

3. Maintain the zero npm dependency approach

4. Run security scans regularly
