## Progress Timeline

### 2025-07-14 - Implementation Phase

- Identified version inconsistencies across MCP servers
- Standardized all MCP SDK versions to 1.15.1
- Created version-check.ts for Deno 2.4.0+ enforcement
- Fixed all linting and TypeScript errors
- Resolved security test failures

### 2025-07-14 - Completion ‚úÖ

- **Version Consistency**: All MCP SDK versions standardized to 1.15.1
- **Security Fixes**: Fixed overly broad `--allow-all` permissions
- **Documentation**: Updated all Deno version requirements to 2.4.0+
- **Preflight Checks**: All linting and type errors resolved
- **GitHub Actions**: All security workflows passing

## Final Completion Status

üéâ **Project Moved to Done Status**: 2025-08-01

This project has been successfully completed and archived. All version inconsistencies have been resolved, preflight
checks are passing, and security compliance has been achieved. The codebase is now ready for continued development with
consistent versioning standards.
