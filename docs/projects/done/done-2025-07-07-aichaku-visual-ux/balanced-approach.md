# Balanced Visual Identity Approach

## The Right Balance

After feedback, we've refined the visual identity to be clear and professional
while maintaining the warm 愛着 (aichaku) feeling through subtle visual cues.

## What We Keep

1. **🪴 Icon** - Primary identity marker for all Aichaku messages

2. **Growth Icons** - 🌱🌿🌳🍃 as subtle phase indicators

3. **Green Progress** - Consider using green colors for progress bars
   (implementation-specific)

## What We Avoid

1. **Garden Metaphors** - No "planting", "growing", "harvesting" in text

2. **Confusing Language** - Keep technical terms clear (create, not plant)

3. **Overuse** - Icons complement, don't replace clear communication

## Good Examples

✅ **Clear and Professional:**

````text
🪴 Aichaku: Creating project: user-auth-redesign
🪴 Aichaku: Sprint 15, Day 6/10 🌿
🪴 Aichaku: Documents created in .claude/output/
```text

❌ **Too Metaphorical:**

```text
🪴 Aichaku: Planting new seeds in your garden
🪴 Aichaku: Your project is blooming nicely
🪴 Aichaku: Time to harvest your work
```text

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Primary Messages**: Always prefix with 🪴 Aichaku:

2. **Status Updates**: Use growth icons at END of line, not in message

3. **Progress Bars**: Can use green color if terminal supports

4. **Documentation**: Keep technical and clear

## The Result

- Users know when Aichaku is active (🪴 prefix)

- Visual progress through subtle icon indicators

- Professional communication that doesn't confuse

- Maintains the warm 愛着 feeling without overdoing it

This balanced approach ensures Aichaku enhances rather than obscures the user
experience.
