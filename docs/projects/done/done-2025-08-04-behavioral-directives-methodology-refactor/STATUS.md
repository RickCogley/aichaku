## Completed

### Methodology Triggers Migration ‚úÖ

- Moved triggers from behavioral-directives.yaml to individual methodology YAML files
- Updated shape-up.yaml, scrum.yaml, kanban.yaml, lean.yaml with triggers
- Updated corresponding Markdown files to match

### Behavioral Directives Simplification ‚úÖ

- Removed redundant "methodology_detection" section
- Updated language from "detection" to "selection" throughout
- Redesigned behavioral-directives.yaml for clarity and impact
- Prioritized context awareness as the highest priority

### CLAUDE.md Reordering ‚úÖ

- Modified yaml-config-reader.ts to put application info first
- Application context now appears before other configurations
- Fixed has_user_customizations to include app-description.yaml
- Removed redundant doc_standards from included section

### Documentation Updates ‚úÖ

- Updated methodologies/README.md to reflect selection over detection
- Changed language to emphasize user choice

### Integration Testing ‚úÖ

- Fixed trigger loading from root level of YAML files
- Updated global aichaku installation files
- Verified CLAUDE.md generation works correctly
- Confirmed triggers appear properly in merged output

## In Progress

None - All work completed!

## Up Next

### Final Verification

- Run through complete workflow
- Ensure triggers work properly
- Verify CLAUDE.md generation is correct

## Rabbit Holes Avoided

- Didn't try to redesign the entire methodology system
- Kept changes focused on the specific issues identified
- Avoided over-engineering the behavioral directives

## Key Decisions

1. **Simplicity over complexity**: Reduced behavioral directives to 4 clear rules
2. **Context first**: Made context awareness the highest priority
3. **User agency**: Emphasized that users select, we don't detect
4. **Clear workflow**: Simplified to discuss ‚Üí create, no complex phases
