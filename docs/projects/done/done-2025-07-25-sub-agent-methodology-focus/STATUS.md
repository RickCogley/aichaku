# Sub-Agent Methodology Focus

**Project Status:** üçÇ Complete\
**Started:** 2025-07-25\
**Completed:** 2025-07-28\
**Methodology:** Shape Up\
**Type:** Feature Development

## Problem Statement

Context window limitations kill continuity in long development sessions with Aichaku. Current approach loads all
methodologies into context regardless of relevance, causing bloat and losing historical decisions.

## Solution

Implement specialized sub-agents with methodology-focused context management:

- Users select specific methodologies per project
- Agents maintain their own context windows
- Orchestrator coordinates workflows
- Focused context loading based on active methodologies

## Key Deliverables (Updated)

1. **6 Core Agents**:
   - ‚úÖ security-reviewer
   - ‚úÖ methodology-coach
   - ‚úÖ orchestrator (NEW - general coordinator)
   - ‚úÖ documenter (NEW - documentation specialist)
   - ‚úÖ code-explorer (NEW - codebase discovery)
   - ‚úÖ api-architect (NEW - API documentation)
   - ‚ùå ~~learning-mentor~~ (removed - too interactive)
   - ‚ùå ~~development-logger~~ (removed - Claude maintains context)

2. **Methodology Management**: ‚úÖ `aichaku methodologies` command suite
3. **Smart Install**: ‚úÖ Prompt for methodology selection with defaults
4. **Context Optimization**: ‚úÖ Load only relevant methodology content

## Current Sprint Progress

‚úÖ **Completed:**

- All 6 core agents implemented with cross-functional configuration
- Agent architecture design (updated)
- Agent templates with YAML frontmatter and delegation patterns
- Methodology command implementation
- Agent generation logic with methodology-aware context
- Documentation merge functionality (merge-docs command)
- Context optimization (12,000 ‚Üí 4,000 tokens)
- Test project created and validated
- 4 new documentation templates added
- **Technology Expert Templates** (Post-completion enhancement):
  - ‚úÖ TypeScript Expert - Type systems, generics, decorators
  - ‚úÖ Python Expert - Async patterns, dataclasses, testing
  - ‚úÖ Go Expert - Concurrency, channels, performance
  - ‚úÖ React Expert - Hooks, server components, Next.js
  - ‚úÖ Deno Expert - Permissions, KV store, FFI
  - ‚úÖ Tailwind Expert - Utility-first CSS, responsive design
  - ‚úÖ Vento Expert - Template engine (used in Lume & Nagare)
  - ‚úÖ Lume Expert - Static site generator
  - ‚úÖ PostgreSQL Expert - Query optimization, schemas
  - Each template includes ~10 idiomatic code examples

üìã **Future Enhancements:**

- Additional development agents (code-archaeologist completed as code-explorer)
- More technology-specific experts (Rust, Java, etc.)
- Enhanced template resolution hierarchy
- Principles guidance system (new project created)

## Architecture Files

1. **IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Consolidated implementation guide (START HERE)
2. **agent-architecture.md** - Original technical architecture (historical context)
3. **comprehensive-agent-system-plan.md** - Expanded system vision (future roadmap)

## Success Criteria

- Development sessions maintain context over extended periods
- Users can focus on specific methodologies without bloat
- Agents coordinate effectively through delegation
- Professional documentation lifecycle managed automatically

## Key Decisions

- Agents work behind-the-scenes (no direct user interaction)
- Orchestrator serves as general coordinator, not just for docs
- User maintains control over all operations
- Leverage existing template infrastructure

## Notes

- Testing approach: ~/.claude/agents/ with "aichaku-" prefix
- MVP focus: Core agents first, expand based on usage
- Documentation merge requires user approval
- Expanded vision: Complete development assistant platform for aichaku users
- Development agents: code-archaeologist, code-reviewer, api-architect, etc.
- Technology experts: deno-expert, TypeScript-expert, bash-expert, etc.
